<hr>
<p>(A customer walks in the door.)
<p><b>Customer:</b> Good Morning.
<p><b>Owner:</b> Good morning, Sir. Welcome to the National Cheese Emporium!
<p><b>Customer:</b> Ah, thank you, my good man.
<p><b>Owner:</b> What can I do for you, Sir?
<p><b>C:</b> Well, I was, uh, sitting in the public library on Thurmon Street just now, skimming through "Rogue Herrys" by Hugh Walpole, and I suddenly came over all peckish.

<p><b>O:</b> Peckish, sir?
<p><b>C:</b> Esuriant.
<p><b>O:</b> Eh?
<p><b>C:</b> 'Ee, Ah wor 'ungry-loike!
<p><b>O:</b> Ah, hungry!
<p><b>C:</b> In a nutshell. And I thought to myself, "a little fermented curd will do the trick," so, I curtailed my Walpoling activites, sallied forth, and infiltrated your place of purveyance to negotiate the vending of some cheesy comestibles!
<p><b>O:</b> Come again?
<p><b>C:</b> I want to buy some cheese.
<p><b>O:</b> Oh, I thought you were complaining about the bazouki player!
<p><b>C:</b> Oh, heaven forbid: I am one who delights in all manifestations of the Terpsichorean muse!
<p><b>O:</b> Sorry?
<p><b>C:</b> 'Ooo, Ah lahk a nice tuune, 'yer forced too!
<p><b>O:</b> So he can go on playing, can he?
<p><b>C:</b> Most certainly! Now then, some cheese please, my good man.
<p><b>O:</b> (lustily) Certainly, sir. What would you like?
<p><b>C:</b> Well, eh, how about a little red Leicester.
<p><b>O:</b> I'm, a-fraid we're fresh out of red Leicester, sir.
<p><b>C:</b> Oh, never mind, how are you on Tilsit?
<p><b>O:</b> I'm afraid we never have that at the end of the week, sir, we get it fresh on Monday.
<p><b>C:</b> Tish tish. No matter. Well, stout yeoman, four ounces of Caerphilly, if you please.
<p><b>O:</b> Ah! It's beeeen on order, sir, for two weeks. Was expecting it this morning.
<p><b>C:</b> 'T's Not my lucky day, is it? Aah, Bel Paese?
<p><b>O:</b> Sorry, sir.

<p><b>O:</b> Yessir. It's..ah,.....it's a bit runny...
<p><b>C:</b> Oh, I like it runny.
<p><b>O:</b> Well,.. It's very runny, actually, sir.
<p><b>C:</b> No matter. Fetch hither the fromage de la Belle France! Mmmwah!
<p><b>O:</b> I...think it's a bit runnier than you'll like it, sir.
<p><b>C:</b> I don't care how fucking runny it is. Hand it over with all speed.
<p><b>O:</b> Oooooooooohhh........! &lt;pause>
<p><b>C:</b> What now?
<p><b>O:</b> The cat's eaten it.

<p><b>C:</b> No no... don't tell me. I'm keen to guess.
<p><b>O:</b> Fair enough.
<p><b>C:</b> Uuuuuh, Wensleydale.
<p><b>O:</b> Yes?
<p><b>C:</b> Ah, well, I'll have some of that!
<p><b>O:</b> Oh! I thought you were talking to me, sir. Mister Wensleydale, that's my name.

<p><b>O:</b> Not 'round here, sir.
<p><b>C:</b> &lt;slight pause> and what IS the most popular cheese 'round hyah?
<p><b>O:</b> 'Illchester, sir.
<p><b>C:</b> IS it.
<p><b>O:</b> Oh, yes, it's staggeringly popular in this manusquire.
<p><b>C:</b> Is it.
<p><b>O:</b> It's our number one best seller, sir!
<p><b>C:</b> I see. Uuh...'Illchester, eh?
<p><b>O:</b> Right, sir.
<p><b>C:</b> All right. Okay. "Have you got any?" He asked, expecting the answer 'no'.
<p><b>O:</b> I'll have a look, sir.. nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnno.
<p><b>C:</b> It's not much of a cheese shop, is it?
<p><b>O:</b> Finest in the district!
<p><b>C:</b> (annoyed) Explain the logic underlying that conclusion, please.
<p><b>O:</b> Well, it's so clean, sir!
<p><b>C:</b> It's certainly uncontaminated by cheese....
<p><b>O:</b> (brightly) You haven't asked me about Limburger, sir.

<p>I never wanted to do this in the first place! I... I wanted to be...
<p>A LUMBERJACK!
<p>(piano vamp)
<p>Leaping from tree to tree! As they float down the mighty rivers of British Columbia! With my best girl by my side! The Larch! The Pine! The Giant Redwood tree! The Sequoia! The Little Whopping Rule Tree! We'd sing! Sing! Sing!
<p>Oh, I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay, I sleep all night and I work all day.
<p><b>CHORUS:</b> He's a lumberjack, and he's okay, He sleeps all night and he works all day.
<p>I cut down trees, I eat my lunch, I go to the lava-try. On Wednesdays I go shoppin' And have buttered scones for tea.
<p>Mounties: He cuts down trees, he eats his lunch, He goes to the lava-try. On Wednesdays 'e goes shoppin' And has buttered scones for tea.
<p><b>CHORUS</b>
<p>I cut down trees, I skip and jump, I like to press wild flowers. I put on women's clothing, And hang around in bars.
<p>Mounties: He cuts down trees, he skips and jumps, He likes to press wild flowers. He puts on women's clothing And hangs around.... In bars???????
<p><b>CHORUS</b>
<p>I chop down trees, I wear high heels, Suspenders and a bra. I wish I'd been a girlie Just like my dear papa.
<p>Mounties: He cuts down trees, he wears high heels Suspenders and a .... a Bra???? (spoken, raggedly) What's this? Wants to be a *girlie*? Oh, My! And I thought you were so rugged! Poofter!
<p><b>CHORUS</b>
<p>All: He's a lumberjack, and he's okaaaaaaayyy.....
