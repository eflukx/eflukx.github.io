<p>The boards and circuit for this project are slightly different from the published design, and the supplied circuit and BOM reflect the new schematic. There are some useful enhancements to the amp, which improve performance and make this a very easy amplifier to build.
<p>The layout comprises <b>two</b> amplifiers, individually fused on board. The board is designed to be able to be cut down the middle for separate amplifiers, and also includes provision for a resistor and a pair of links to convert to bridge operation. Signal take-off points are provided so a SIM (Sound Impairment Monitor) can be connected easily, if you so desire. If flat-pack transistors are used, they are mounted on the board for the simplest mounting possible, or the edge of the board can be cut off and TO-3 transistors can be used.
<p>This project has proven to be very popular, and a great many constructors have commented extremely favourably on the sound quality of the amp. This is not an amplifier to be under-estimated, and is highly recommended for serious hi-fi.</p>
