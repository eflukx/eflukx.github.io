<p>Boards are normally shipped in a padded postal bag via normal mail (Airmail for international orders), and this is at the rate shown in the pricelist. Where possible, orders are sent as 'large letter' in a padded bag. Customs forms are not required by Australia Post for the padded bags, and are not used unless the package has to be sent as a 'parcel' (anything that is bigger than a large letter).</p>

<p>Overseas orders are subject to postage and handling charges for airmail, and I have established a fixed postal charge based on experience (see the <a href="pricelist.html" target="_blank">Price List</a> for details and current rate).</p>

<p>All necessary construction details are available on-line. You will get access to the secure section of ESP's website with any purchase, and can print the documentation from there. This includes a full schematic, any modifications to the published version, circuit board overlay and a bill of materials.</p>

<p>If desired, a CD containing all project material available from the secure site can be obtained for a nominal cost with any order. This is provided free with any order over AU$100.00 (excluding GST or postage) CDs are <i>not</i> available by themselves, they may be purchased only in conjunction with PCBs. Secure site login details are provided <i>only</i> for PCB purchases.</p>
<p>There is no documentation available for the extension shaft, and if purchased by itself you do <i>not</i> get access to the construction pages.</p>
