<p><b>Encrypted Form</b><br>
The encrypted order form (zipped archive) can be downloaded to your PC (about 13k - smaller than the HTML form).  It includes a small user interface to generate and encrypt the order, which is assigned a random number, and may then safely be e-mailed. All data is heavily encrypted, and does not use a password - encryption is one-way only, and you cannot decrypt the order file.  Decryption is only possible at my machine (I have the <i>only</i> copy of the decryption software in existence). No decrypted card data is maintained on my PC - the only copy of the form with that information is printed for my records. You must read and agree to the terms of use in the README.TXT file included in the zipped file.</p>
<p>The order program includes the facility to allow you to download the latest price list direct from the ESP website. Simply make sure you are connected to the Internet, and click the "Download" button. Make sure that your price list version matches that shown above.</p>

<p><b><small>Note that the use (and transmission to my e-mail address) of the encrypted form represents your digital signature, and is a binding contract for sale of goods. Use of the form indicates that you (or the cardholder where the buyer and cardholder are different persons) are authorised to use the card details supplied, and will not dispute the charges unless ESP has made a mistake in the transaction. In the latter case, you must contact ESP <i>first</i>, and it is almost certain that the dispute can be resolved to everyone's satisfaction.</small></b></p>

<ul><li>Do <b>not</b> e-mail a scan of the HTML order form, to avoid unauthorised persons obtaining your card details.&nbsp; For e-mail, use only the encrypted order form.</li>
<li>Use the Australian dollar price for all orders <i>other than</i> PayPal.</li>
<li>If you do not have Javascript enabled on your browser, you will have to do the calculations on the order form yourself.&nbsp; ESP reserves the right to change prices indicated if incorrectly entered.</li>
<li>Use the codes exactly as shown on the price list.&nbsp; Any order code you "create" is unhelpful to me :-)</li>
<li>When entering quantities in the HTML form, use only digits, or the Javascript will be unable to calculate the correct values.</li>
<li>Do not specify a dollar (or other currency) limit on any order. The exchange rate is outside of my control, and you will be billed at the exchange rate that is current at the time your card details are processed. I cannot process any order with a specified limit.</li>
<li>If there is a potential problem with your customs departments (e.g. $US50 maximum per parcel), I can split the shipment. Postage is payable on each individual package. I will <b><i>not</i></b> falsify customs forms!</li>
<li>Faxed orders <b>must</b> be printed in black - fax machines do not respond well to blue, and the fax is likely to be illegible upon receipt. High resolution mode is recommended if available.</li>
<li>Please do not send cover sheets or other un-necessary sheets by fax - all needed information is on the order form.</li>
<li>No order form is required for PayPal or Paymate purchases. See <a href="buy.htm">How To Purchase</a> for details.</li>
<li>If you download the order encryption program, you <b>must</b> read the file README.TXT before use.</li>
</ul>

<hr><b>Security</b><br>
While no encryption program can claim to be unbreakable, the ESP order form is actually potentially more secure than even a fax transmission. While it would be possible for a determined hacker to decode the information, it is much more difficult than they might anticipate, and they are also left with the problem of intercepting e-mails. Neither task is trivial.
<p>For example, the (dummy) record shown below shows the original text and the encrypted version (the upper case 'X' characters may be an upper case X or an unprintable character, outside the normal ASCII character range).</p>

<small><b>Comparison Between Plain Text and Encrypted (Cipher) Text</b></small></center>

<p>As you can see, there is no correlation between the two. A character will usually not be encrypted to the same character twice, may be encrypted to itself (i.e. no change - the lack of this ability made the Enigma machine from WWII easier to 'crack' than would otherwise have been the case), and the cipher text isn't even text - it contains 'unprintable characters' such as line feeds, carriage returns and control codes.</p>
<p>Two identical orders will produce identical encrypted files, but if just one character is changed anywhere within the order, the file will be different.</p>
<p>Is the code unbreakable? ... no. The most sophisticated encryption currently available can be broken given enough time and a good enough reason (the reason has to be good, as the cost is huge!). However, it remains far more secure than most alternatives.</p>
