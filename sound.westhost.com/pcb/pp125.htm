<p>This 4-Way 24dB/Octave crossover board is the latest revision of the board. Unlike most ESP boards, this one is double-sided with plated-through holes. Be careful during assembly, because rework will almost certainly damage the PCB unless you have experience with double-sided boards.
<p>The layout (marked as LRX424) contains one mono 4-way crossover, and is slightly different from the description in the project article. Regulators are on board, but it's also easy to use an external power supply if preferred. (the P05 power supply for example).
<p>Note that there are three identical small errors on the PCB (again!), and the price has been reduced. The errors are very easy to fix.</p>
