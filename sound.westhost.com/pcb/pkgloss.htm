<p>Package losses are extremely rare, but for shipping to the some countries, insurance is highly recommended. Please see the <a href="pricelist.html" target="_blank">price list</a> for the most up-to-date information I have available on those countries that do not allow insurance.</p>
<p>Please note that if you want goods shipped to a country where you have <i>any</i> doubts about the postal system, then you must understand and accept that my responsibility stops when the package is posted. Should the package go missing, it is your responsibility entirely, and no refunds shall be given for lost goods.</p>
<p>Most of the countries I ship to regularly seem to be very safe, and although there have been delays (mostly as a result of airline security measures) there have been virtually no total losses. If you live in any of the following areas, you are (probably) safe without insurance ...
<ul><li>Australia</li>
<li>USA (Package must be sent as a parcel, at additional cost to me)</li>
<li>Canada (Insurance not available)</li>
<li>United Kingdom</li>
<li>Europe (most countries)</li>
<li>Scandinavia</li>
<li>New Zealand</li>
<li>Singapore</li></ul>
There are almost certainly others as well, but these are the most popular destinations.
<p>I regret having to do this, but I simply cannot afford to have a shipment go missing, and lose the cost of the boards, packaging, postage and time. I will (as far as is possible) try to verify that the loss was not within Australia and to do whatever I can to track down your package, but it is extremely difficult to track an uninsured package through the postal systems of the world.</p>
