<p><b>Note: </b>This is a short-form kit - you need to supply some parts, but all the hard-to-get components are included.</p>
<p>This microphone housing is basically as shown in the P93 article. The case is turned from solid aluminium, and has an extension tube for the electret microphone. The case is 25mm (1") diameter and is 100mm long - the completed unit is 150mm in length overall - including the microphone (not supplied) and the XLR connector (supplied). Finish is sandblasted aluminium.

<p><b>You get</b> - a complete housing (including screws to hold the extension tube and XLR in place), a turned XLR connector that fits perfectly into the end, the PCB, a length of copper stick-on tape for earthing the housing to pin 1 of the XLR, 5 PCB pins and 2 ferrite beads - in other words, all the parts that you would find it difficult to get elsewhere.  A project CD is automatically included with your order.</p>
<blockquote><small>Please note that there may be some (very) minor tooling marks on the casings - unfortunately, because these are hand made, this is unavoidable without excessive additional machining which would only increase the cost. Most housings will have some evidence of the machining processes, but this will in no way affect the performance or overall appearance of the finished microphone.</small></blockquote>

<p><b>You need</b> - the electret microphone element, the transistors and other parts for the PCB, some insulation for the inside of the tube, a short length of heatshrink tubing to attach the microphone to the end of the tube and some hookup wire to connect the microphone to the PCB.</p>
