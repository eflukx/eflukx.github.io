<hr><b>Introduction</b>
<p>This project is probably the most ambitious so far, and can be expected to be very expensive.&nbsp; On the positive side, it is also capable of excellent performance, and can be tailored to suit your exact specifications.&nbsp; There are several different input modules in the series, the first being the microphone and line input.</p>
<p>The project is presented in parts, and Part 1 shows the mic/line module and has some background information on noise measurements and the general philosophy behind the project.</p>
<p>Stages 2 and 3 are now complete, and are described below, and Stage 4 is available, but still under construction.</p>

<hr><b>Description</b>
<p>Since the project is presented in stages, this is an index for the various modules, and as the system is developed will also be the place to look for updates and other information.</p>

<tr><td valign="top"><b><a href="project30a.htm">Stage 1</a></b></td>
<td><b>Microphone / Line input module</b> - Includes optional 48V phantom feed, and shows three different input stage configurations.&nbsp; You can choose from transformer input, or two different electronically balanced circuits.&nbsp; Also shows the tone control circuits, peak level indicator and all channel to group/master switching, faders and pan pots.</td>

<tr><td valign="top"><b><a href="project30b.htm">Stage 2</a></b></td>
<td><b>Basic Mixing Modules</b> - These are used for mixing the stereo sends from each of the Mic/Line modules, either as sub-mixers or the main mixer (the same unit is used for each).&nbsp; Also included are the Auxiliary Mix Module and balanced line driver circuits, and the first stage of the power supplies.</td><td valign="top"><i>23 Oct 1999</i></td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top"><b><a href="project30c.htm">Stage 3</a></b></td>
<td><b>Power Stages</b> - This section shows the power supply regulators - both +/-15V main supplies and 48V phantom supply, and the headphone power amps.</td><td valign="top"><i>26 Nov 1999</i></td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top"><b><a href="project30d.htm">Stage 4</a></b></td>
<td><b>Bits and Pieces</b> - The next installment will describe the pre-fade listen and other headphone mixing and switching, as well as the talkback mic amp, phono and auxiliary input modules.&nbsp; (See <font size=-1>NOTE</font> below.)&nbsp; Stage 4 is under construction,
and contains descriptive text only at this time.</td>
<td valign="top"></td></tr></table>

<p>The additional modules, metering and a complete system layout will be added to the list as they are developed.</p>

<p><b><font size=-1>NOTE:&nbsp; </font></b>There has been a surprising amount of interest in this project, with a common requirement being a smaller version (an almost equally common request has been for a bigger version, too).&nbsp; Scaling the project up is not really a problem, but it is difficult to know what you can leave out to make a small mixer of 6 channels or less.</p>

<p>It seems I have also managed to confuse a few people with some of the links between the various stages.&nbsp; I used two different terms for the same one in one instance, and the links made sense to me at the time, but this has not helped some of my readers.&nbsp; Sorry about this, and I will try to find and fix the errors (whether of nomenclature or common sense) Most should be alright, but there may be a few remaining.</p>
