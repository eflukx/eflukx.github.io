<hr><b>A</b> man left work one Friday afternoon. Being payday, instead of going home, he stayed out the entire weekend hunting with the boys and spent his entire paycheck. When he finally appeared at home, Sunday night, he was confronted by a very angry wife and was barraged for nearly two hours with a tirade befitting his actions.
<p>Finally, his wife stopped the nagging and simply said to him, "How would you like it if you didn't see me for two or three days?" To which he replied, "That would be fine with me."
<p>Monday went by and he didn't see his wife.
<p>Tuesday and Wednesday came and went with the same results.
<p>Thursday, the swelling went down just enough where he could see her a little out of the corner of his left eye.

<hr><b>T</b>hree men died on Christmas Eve and were met by Saint Peter at the pearly gates. "In honor of this holy season," Saint Peter said, "you must each possess something that symbolises Christmas to get into heaven."
<p>The first man fumbled through his pockets and pulled out a lighter. He flicked it on. "It represents a candle," he said. "You may pass through the pearly gates," Saint Peter said.
<p>The second man reached into his pocket and pulled out a set of keys. He shook them and said, "They're bells." Saint Peter said, "you may pass through the pearly gates."
<p>The third man started searching desperately through his pockets and finally pulled out a pair of women's panties. St. Peter looked at the man with a raised eyebrow and asked, "And just what do those symbolise?" The man replied, "They're Carol's."

<hr><b>A</b> firefighter is working on the engine outside the station when he notices a little girl next door in a little red wagon with little ladders hung off the sides and a garden hose tightly coiled in the middle. The girl is wearing a firefighter's helmet. The wagon is being pulled by her dog and her cat. The firefighter walks over to take a closer look.
<p>"That sure is a nice fire truck", the firefighter says with admiration. "Thanks", the girl says. The firefighter takes a closer look and notices the girl has tied her wagon to the dog's collar and the cat's testicles. "Little Partner", the firefighter says, "I don't want to tell you how to run your rig, but if you were to tie that rope around the cat's collar, I think you could go faster." The little girl replies thoughtfully, "You're probably right, but then I wouldn't have a siren."

<hr><b>A</b> successful businessman flew to Vegas for the weekend to gamble. He lost the shirt off his back, and had nothing left but a quarter and the second half of his round trip ticket -- If he could just get to the airport he could get himself home. So he went out to the front of the casino where there was a cab waiting. He got in and explained his situation to the cabbie. He promised to send the driver money from home, he offered him his credit card numbers, his drivers license number, his address, etc. but to no avail. The cabbie said (adopt appropriate dialect), "If you don't have fifteen dollars, get the hell out of my cab!" So the businessman was forced to hitch-hike to the airport and was barely in time to catch his flight.
<p>One year later the businessman, having worked long and hard to regain his financial success, returned to Vegas and this time he won big. Feeling pretty good about himself, he went out to the front of the casino to get a cab ride back to the airport. Well who should he see out there, at the end of a long line of cabs, but his old buddy who had refused to give him a ride when he was down on his luck.
<p>The businessman thought for a moment about how he could make the guy pay for his lack of charity, and he hit on a plan. The businessman got in the first cab in the line, "How much for a ride to the airport, " he asked? "Fifteen bucks" came the reply. "And how much for you to give me a blowjob on the way?" "What?! Get the hell out of my cab." The businessman got into the back of each cab in the long line and asked the same questions, with the same result.
<p>When he got to his old friend at the back of the line, he got in and asked "How much for a ride to the airport?" The cabbie replied "fifteen bucks." The businessman said "ok" and off they went. Then, as the drove slowly past the long line of cabs the businessman gave a big smile and thumbs up sign to each driver.

<hr><b>A</b> guy was sitting quietly reading his paper when his wife walked up behind him and whacked him on the head with a frying pan.
<p>"What was that for?" he asked.
<p>"That was for the piece of paper in your pants pocket with the name Mary Lou written on it," she replied.
<p>"Two weeks ago when I went to the races, Mary Lou was the name of one of the horses I bet on," he explained.
<p>"Oh honey, I'm sorry," she said. "I should have known there was a good explanation."
<p>Three days later he was watching football on the telly when she walked up and hit him in the head again, this time with the iron skillet, which knocked him out cold. When he came to, he asked, "What was that for?"
<p>"Your horse called."

<hr><b>A</b> boss wondered why one of his most valued employees had not phoned in sick one day. Having an urgent problem with one of the main computers, he dialled the employee's home phone number and was greeted with a child's whisper.
<p>"Hello, is your daddy home?" he asked.
<p>"Yes," whispered the small voice.
<p>May I talk with him?"
<p>The child whispered, "No."
<p>Surprised and wanting to talk with an adult, the boss asked, "Is your Mummy there?"
<p>"Yes."
<p>"May I talk with her?"
<p>Again the small voice whispered, "No."
<p>Hoping there was somebody with whom he could leave a message, the boss asked, "Is anybody else there?"
<p>"Yes," whispered the child, "a policeman"
<p>Wondering what a cop would be doing at his employee's home, the boss asked, "May I speak with the policeman?"
<p>"No, he's busy", whispered the child.
<p>"Busy doing what?"
<p>"Talking to Daddy and Mummy and the Fireman," came the whispered answer.
<p>Growing more worried as he heard what sounded like a helicopter through the earpiece on the phone, the boss asked, "What is that noise?"
<p>"A helicopter" answered the whispering voice.
<p>"What is going on there?" demanded the boss, now truly apprehensive.
<p>Again, whispering, the child answered, "The search team just landed the helicopter."
<p>Alarmed, concerned and a little frustrated the boss asked, "What are they searching for?"
<p>Still whispering, the young voice replied with a muffled giggle: "ME."

<hr><b>B</b>rian came home from the pub late one Friday evening stinking drunk, as he often did, and crept into bed beside his wife who was already asleep. He gave her a peck on the cheek and fell asleep. When he awoke he found a strange man standing at the end of his bed wearing a long flowing white robe." Who the hell are you?" Demanded Brian, "and what are you doing in my bedroom?". 
<p>The mysterious Man answered "This isn't your bedroom and I'm St Peter". Brian was stunned "You mean I'm dead!!! That can't be, I have so much to live for, I haven't said goodbye to my family.... you've got to send me back straight away". St Peter replied "Yes you can be reincarnated but there is a catch. We can only send you back as a dog or a hen."
<p>Brian was devastated, but knowing there was a farm not far from his house, he asked to be sent back as a hen. A flash of light later he was covered in feathers and clucking around pecking the ground. "This ain't so bad" he thought until he felt this strange feeling welling up inside him. The farmyard rooster strolled over and said "So you're the new hen, how are you enjoying your first day here?" "It's not so bad" replies Brian, "but I have this strange feeling inside like I'm about to explode".
<p>"You're ovulating" explained the rooster, "don't tell me you've never laid an egg before". "Never" replies Brian "Well just relax and let it happen" And so he did and after a few uncomfortable seconds later, an egg pops out from under his tail. An immense feeling of relief swept over him and his emotions got the better of him as he experienced motherhood for the first time. When he laid his second egg, the feeling of happiness was overwhelming and he knew that being reincarnated as a hen was the best thing that ever happened to him... ever!!!
<p>The joy kept coming and as he was just about to lay his third egg he felt an enormous smack on the back of his head and heard his wife shouting ..... "Brian, wake up you drunken bastard, you're shitting in the bed!!"

<hr><b>A</b> child asks his mother, "Do all fairy tales begin with, 'Once upon a time?'"
<p>His mother answers, "No, dear. Once in a while they begin with 'I'll be working late at the office tonight.'"
<p>"Does Daddy tell you fairy tales like that ?"
<p>"He used to."
<p>"What made him stop ?"
<p>"One day he told me he'd be working late, and I said, 'Can I depend on that ?'"

<hr><b>A</b>n 80 year old woman was arrested for shop lifting.
<p>When she went before the judge he asked her, "What did you steal?" She replied: a can of peaches.
<p>The judge asked her why she had stolen them and she replied that she was hungry. The judge then asked her how many peaches were in the can. She replied 6.
<p>The judge then said, "I will give you 6 days in jail."
<p>Before the judge could actually pronounce the punishment the woman's husband spoke up and asked the judge if he could say something. He said, " What is it? "
<p>The husband said "She also stole a can of peas."

<hr><b>A</b> guy with a black eye boards his plane bound for Pittsburgh and sits down in his seat. He notices immediately that the guy next to him has a black eye, too. He says to him, "Hey, this is a coincidence. We both have black eyes; mind if I ask how you got yours?" The other guy says, "Well, it just happened. It was a tongue twister accident. See, I was at the ticket counter and this gorgeous blonde with the most massive breasts in the world was there. So, instead of saying, "I'd like two tickets to Pittsburgh", I accidentally said "I'd like two pickets to Tittsburgh"., so she socked me a good one."

<p>The first guy replied, "Wow! This is unbelievable. Mine was a tongue twister too. I was at the breakfast table and I wanted to say to my wife, "Please pour me a bowl of Frosties, honey." But I accidentally said, "You’ve ruined my life, you evil, self-centered, fat-arsed bitch."

<hr><b>E</b>very day, a male co-worker walks up very close to a lady standing at the coffee machine, inhales a big breath of air and tells her that her hair smells nice. After a week of this, she can't stand it anymore, takes her complaint to a supervisor in the personnel department and states that she wants to write a sexual harassment grievance against him. The Human Resources supervisor is puzzled by this decision and asks, "What's sexually threatening about a co-worker telling you your hair smells nice?" The woman replies, "It's Keith, the midget."

<hr><b>J</b>ust before the funeral services, the undertaker came up to the very elderly widow and asked, "How old was your husband?" "98," she replied. "Two years older than me." "So you're 96," the undertaker commented. She responded, "Hardly worth going home is it?"

<hr><b>A</b> man's car broke down as he was driving past a beautiful old monastery. He walked up the drive and knocked on the front door. A monk answered, listened to the man's story and graciously invited him to spend the night. 
<p>The monks fed him and led him to a tiny chamber in which to sleep. The man slept serenely until he was awakened by a strange and beautiful sound. The next morning, as the monks were repairing his car, he asked about the sound that had woke him. "We're sorry," the monks said. "We can't tell you about the sound. You're not a monk." 
<p>Disappointed, the man went on his way and pondered the source of the alluring sound for several years. One day he again stopped at the monastery, and explained to the monks that he had so enjoyed his previous stay that he wondered if he might be permitted to spend another night under their peaceful roof. Late that night, he again heard the strange, beautiful sound. The following morning he begged the monks to explain the sound but he monks gave him the same answer as before. "We're sorry. We can't tell you about the sound. You're not a monk." 
<br>By now the man's curiosity had turned to obsession. He decided to give up everything to become a monk, for that was the only way he could learn about the sound. He informed the monks of his decision and began the long and arduous task of becoming one of them. Seventeen long years later, the man was finally established as a true member of the order. When the celebration ended, he humbly went to the leader of the order and asked to be told the source of the sound. 
<br>Silently, the old monk led the new monk to a huge wooden door. He opened the door with a golden key. The door swung open to reveal a second door, this one of silver, then a third of gold and so on until they had passed through twelve doors, each more magnificent than the last. The new monk's face was awash with tears of joy as he finally beheld the wondrous source of the beautiful and mysterious sound he had heard so many years before ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... But I can't tell you what it was. You're not a monk.

<hr><b>A</b> woman and a baby were in the doctor's examining room waiting for the doctor to come in for the baby's first exam. Finally the doctor arrived, examined the baby, checked his weight, and being a little concerned, asked if the baby was breast-fed or bottle-fed. "Breast-fed" she replied. <p>"Well! , strip down to your waist," the doctor ordered. She did. He pinched her nipples, then pressed, kneaded, and rubbed both breasts for a while in a detailed examination.
<p>Motioning to her to get dressed, he said, "No wonder this baby is underweight. You don't have any milk." "I know," she said, "I'm his Grandma, but I'm glad I came."

<br><b>T</b>he couple was 85 years old, and had been married for sixty years. Though they were far from rich, they managed to get by because they watched their pennies. Though not young, they were both in very good health, largely due to the wife's insistence on healthy foods and exercise for the last decade. One day, their good health didn't help when they went on a rare vacation and their plane crashed, sending them off to Heaven.

<p>They reached the pearly gates, and St. Peter escorted them inside. He took them to a beautiful mansion, furnished in gold and fine silks, with a fully stocked kitchen and a waterfall in the master bath. A maid could be seen hanging their favorite clothes in the closet. They gasped in astonishment when he said, "Welcome to Heaven. This will be your home now."

<p>The old man asked Peter how much all this was going to cost. "Why, nothing," Peter replied, "remember, this is your reward in Heaven." The old man looked out the window and right there he saw a championship golf course, finer and more beautiful than any ever built on Earth.

<p>"What are the greens fees?" grumbled the old man. "This is heaven," St. Peter replied. "You can play for free, every day."

<p>Next they went to the clubhouse and saw the lavish buffet lunch, with every imaginable cuisine laid out before them, from seafood to steaks to exotic deserts, free flowing beverages. "Don't even ask," said St. Peter to the man. "This is Heaven, it is all free for you to enjoy." The old man looked around and glanced nervously at his wife.

<p>"Well, where are the low fat and low cholesterol foods, and the decaffeinated tea?" he asked. "That's the best part," St. Peter replied. "You can eat and drink as much as you like of whatever you like, and you will never get fat or sick. This IS Heaven!"

<p>The old man pushed, "No gym to work out at?" "Not unless you want to," was the answer. "No testing my sugar or blood pressure or..." Never again. All you do here is enjoy yourself."

<p>The old man glared at his wife and said, "You and your fucking bran muffins. We could have been here ten years ago!"

<hr><b>A</b> couple attending an art exhibition at the National Gallery were staring at a portrait that had them totally confused. The painting depicted three black men totally naked, sitting on a park bench. Two of the men had black penises, but the one seated in the middle, had a pink penis.

<p>The curator of the gallery realised the confused couple were having trouble with interpreting the painting and offered his assessment. He went on and on for nearly half an hour explaining how it depicted the sexual emasculation of African-Americans in a predominantly white, patriarchal society. "In fact", he pointed out, "some serious critics believe that the pink penis reflects the cultural and sociological oppression expressed by gay men in a contemporary society".

<p>After the curator left, a Scotsman man approached the couple and said, "Would you like to know what the painting is really about?"

<p>"Now why would you claim to be more of an expert than the curator of the Gallery?" asked the couple.

<p>"Because I'm the guy who painted it," he replied. "In fact, there is no African-American representation at all. They're just three Scottish coal-miners. The guy in the middle went home for lunch."

<hr><b>P</b>assengers on a small commuter plane are waiting for the flight to leave. They're getting a little impatient, but the airport staff assures them that the pilots will be there soon, and the flight can take off.

<p>The entrance opens, and two men dressed in pilot's uniforms walk up the aisle. Both are wearing dark glasses, one is using a seeing eye dog, and the other is tapping his way up the aisle with a cane.

<p>Nervous laughter spreads through the cabin but the men enter the cockpit, the door closes, and the engines start up.

<p>The passengers begin glancing nervously around, searching for some sign that this is just a little practical joke. None is forthcoming.

<p>The plane moves faster and faster down the runway, and the people at the windows realise that they're headed straight for the water at the edge of the airport territory.

<p>As it begins to look as though the plane will plow into the water, panicked screams fill the cabin. At that moment, the plane lifts smoothly into the air.

<p>The passengers relax and laugh a little sheepishly, and soon all retreat into their magazines, secure in the knowledge that the plane is in good hands.

<p>In the cockpit, the co-pilot turns to the pilot and says, "You know, Bob, one of these days, they're gonna scream too late, and we're all gonna die." 

<hr><b>W</b>hat with all the sadness and trauma going on in the world at the moment, it is worth reflecting on the death of a very important person which almost went un-noticed last week.

<p>Larry La Prise, the man who wrote "The Hokey Cokey" died peacefully at age 93.
<p>The most traumatic part for his family was getting him into the coffin.
<p>They put his left leg in... and then the trouble started.

<hr><b>I</b>n the middle of a gynaecologists conference, an English and a French gynaecologist are discussing various interesting cases they have recently treated.

<p>French gynaecologist : "Only last week, zer was zis woman ooh came to see me, and 'er cleetoris .......eet was like a melon".

<p>English gynaecologist : "Don't be absurd my good man, it could not possibly have been that big, the poor wooman wouldn't have been able to walk if it was".

<hr><b>A</b> scouser walked into the local job centre, marched straight up to the counter and said "Hi, I'm lookin' for a job."

<p>The man behind the counter paused, then replied "Your timing is amazing. We've just got a listing from a very wealthy man who wants a chauffeur/bodyguard for his nympho daughter. You'll have to drive around in a big black Mercedes, uniform provided.

<p>Because of the long hours of this job, meals will also be provided and you will also be required to escort the young lady on her overseas holidays. The salary package is &pound;200,000 a year.".

<p>The scouser said "Nah, you're bullsh!tting me!".

<p>The man behind the counter said "Well you f#ckin' started it!".

<hr><b>A</b> hillbilly went hunting one day in Oklahoma and bagged three ducks.
<p>He put them in the bed of his pickup truck and was about to drive home when he was confronted by an ornery game warden who didn't like hillbillies.
<p>The game warden ordered the hillbilly to show his hunting license, and the hillbilly pulled out a valid Oklahoma hunting license.
<p>The game warden looked at the license, then reached over and picked up one of the ducks, sniffed its butt, and said "This duck ain't from Oklahoma. This is a Kansas duck. You got a Kansas huntin' license, boy?"
<p>The hillbilly reached into his wallet and produced a Kansas hunting license.
<p>The game warden looked at it, then reached over and grabbed the second duck, sniffed its butt, and said "This ain't no Kansas duck. This duck's from Arkansas. You got a Arkansas license?"
<p>The hillbilly reached into his wallet and produced an Arkansas hunting license.
<p>The warden then reached over and picked up the third duck, sniffed its butt, and said This ain't no Arkansas duck. This here duck's from South Carolina. You got a South Carolina huntin' license?"
<p>Again the hillbilly reached into his wallet and brought out a South Carolina hunting license.
<p>The game warden was extremely frustrated at this point, and he yelled at the hillbilly "Just where the hell are you from?"
<p>The hillbilly turned around, bent over, dropped his pants, and said "You tell me, expert."

<hr><b>A</b> man had a terrible passion for baked beans, but they always had a somewhat lively effect on him. After he met the woman of his dreams, he made the supreme sacrifice and gave them up; he couldn't imagine subjecting his new wife to his beastly emissions.
<p>On his birthday, his car broke down, so he called his wife and told her he'd have to walk home. He walked past a cafe and the wonderful aroma of baked beans overwhelmed him. Since he was still a couple of miles from home, he figured he could indulge, and then walk off any ill effects. So he had three extra-large helpings of beans, and he "put-putted" all the way home.
<p>His wife met him at the door and seemed somewhat excited. She exclaimed, "Darling, I have the most wonderful surprise for you for dinner tonight!"
<p>She blindfolded him, and led him to his chair at the head of the table, making him promise not to peek. At this point, he was beginning to feel another one coming on. Just as she was about to remove the blindfold, the telephone rang and she went to answer it.
<p>While she was gone, he seized the opportunity. He shifted his weight to one leg and let go. It was not only loud, but ripe as a rotten egg. He gasped and felt for his napkin and fanned the air about him. He had just started to feel better, when another urge came on. This one sounded like a diesel engine revving, and smelled worse. He tried flapping his arms, to clear the air. But another one snuck out, and the windows rattled, the dishes on the table shook, and a minute later, the flowers on the table were dead.
<p>When he heard his wife ending her conversation, he neatly laid his napkin on his lap and folded his hands on top of it. He was the picture of innocence when she walked in.
<p>Apologising for taking so long, she asked if he had peeked at the dinner. He assured her he had not, so she removed the blindfold and yelled, "Surprise!!!"
<p>To his shock and horror, there were twelve dinner guests seated around the table for his surprise birthday party.

<hr><b>D</b>ear Abby:
<p>I have been engaged for almost a year. I am to be married next month. My fiancee's mother is not only very attractive but really great and understanding. She is putting the entire wedding together and invited me to her place to go over the invitation list because it had grown a bit beyond what we had expected it to be.

<p>When I got to her place we reviewed the list and trimmed it down to just under a hundred ... then she floored me. She said that in a month I would be a married man and that before that happened, she wanted to have sex with me. Then she just stood up and walked to her bedroom and on her way said that I knew where the front door was if I wanted to leave.

<p>I stood there for about five minutes and finally decided that I knew exactly how to deal with this situation. I headed straight out the front door . . .

<p>There, leaning against my car was her husband, my father-in-law to be. He was smiling. He explained that they just wanted to be sure I was a good kid and would be true to their little girl. I shook his hand and he congratulated me on passing their little test.

<p>Abby, should I tell my fiancee' what her parents did, and that I thought their "little test" was asinine and insulting to my character? Or should I keep the whole thing to myself including the fact that the reason I was walking out to my car was to get a condom?

<hr><b>T</b>he Rules Of Bedroom Golf
<ol>
	<li>Each player shall furnish his own equipment for play - normally one club and two balls.<br /><br />
	<li>Play on a course must be approved by the owner of the hole.<br /><br />
	<li>Unlike outdoor golf, the object is to get the club in the hole and keep the balls out of the hole.<br /><br />
	<li>For most effective play, the club should have a firm shaft. Course owners are permitted to check shaft stiffness before play 
	begins.<br /><br />
	<li>Course owners reserve the right to restrict the length of the club to avoid damage to the hole.<br /><br />
	<li>The object of the game is to take as many strokes as necessary until the course owner is satisfied that the play is complete. 
	Failure to do so may result in being denied permission to play the course again.<br /><br />
	<li>It is considered bad form to begin playing the hole immediately upon arrival at the course. The experienced player will normally 
	take time to admire the entire course, with special attention to well formed bunkers.<br /><br />
	<li>Players are cautioned not to mention other courses they have played or are currently playing to the owner of the course being played. 
	Upset course owners have been known to damage a player's equipment for this reason.<br /><br />
	<li>Players are encouraged to have proper rain gear along just in case.<br /><br />
	<li>Players should assure themselves that their match has been properly scheduled, particularly when a new course is being played for 
	the first time. Previous players have been known to be come irate if they discover someone else playing what they consider to be a 
	private course.<br /><br />
	<li>Players should not assume a course is in shape for play at all times. Some players may be embarrassed if they find the course to 
	be temporarily under repair. Players are advised to be extremely tactful in this situation. More advanced players will find alternate 
	means of play when this is the case.<br /><br />
	<li>Players are advised to obtain the course owner's permission before attempting to play the back nine.<br /><br />
	<li>Slow play is encouraged; however, players should be prepared to proceed at a quicker pace, at least temporarily, at the course 
	owners request.<br /><br />
	<li>It is considered outstanding performance, time permitting, to play the same hole several times in one match.<br /><br />
	<li>The course owner will be the sole judge of who is the best player.<br /><br />
	<li>Players are advised to think twice before considering membership at a given course. Additional assessments may be levied by the 
	course owner and the rules are subject to change. For this reason, many players prefer to continue to play several different courses.

<hr><b>A</b>n American tourist goes on a trip to China. While in China, he is very sexually promiscuous and does not use a condom all the time.
<p>A week after arriving back home in the States, he wakes one morning to find his penis covered with bright green and purple spots. Horrified, he immediately goes to see a doctor. The doctor, never having seen anything like this before, orders some tests and tell the man to return in two days for the results.
<p>The man returns a couple of days later and the doctor says: "I've got bad news for you. You've contracted Mongolian VD. It's very rare and almost unheard of here. We know very little about it."
<p>The man looks a little perplexed and says: "Well, give me a shot or something and fix me up, doc".
<p>The doctor answers: "I'm sorry, there no known cure. We're going to have to amputate your penis".
<p>The man screams in horror, "Absolutely not! I want a second opinion".
<p>The doctor replies: "Well, it's your choice. Go ahead if you want, but surgery is your only choice".
<p>The next day, the man seeks out a Chinese doctor, figuring that he'll know more about the disease. The Chinese doctor examines his penis and proclaims: "Ah, yes, Mongolian VD. Vely lare disease".
<p>The guy says to the doctor: "Yeah, yeah, I already know that, but what we can do? My American doctor wants to operate and amputate my penis?"
<p>The Chinese doctor shakes his head and laughs: "Stupid Amelican docta, always want to opelate. Make more money, that way. No need to opelate!"
<p>"Oh, Thank God!", the man replies.
<p>"Yes", says the Chinese doctor, "You no worry! Wait two weeks. Dick fall off by itself! You save money"

<hr><b>Helpful Household Hints</b>
<ul>
	<li>If a small child is choking on an ice cube, don't panic. Simply pour a jug of boiling water down its throat and hey presto! The blockage 
	is almost instantly removed.<br /><br />
	<li>Manchester United fans. Save money on expensive new kits by simply strapping a large fake penis to your forehead. It is now clear to all, 
	as to your allegiance.<br /><br />
	<li>Clumsy? Avoid cutting yourself while slicing vegetables by getting someone else to hold them while you chop away.<br /><br />
	<li>Keep the seat next to you on the train vacant by smiling and nodding at people as they walk up the aisle.<br /><br />
	<li>Weight watchers. Avoid that devilish temptation to nibble at the chocolate bar in the cupboard or fridge by not buying the fucking thing
	in the first place, you fat bastards.<br /><br />
	<li>Save on booze by drinking cold tea instead of whisky. The following morning you can create the effects of a hangover by drinking a 
	thimble full of washing up liquid and banging your head repeatedly on the wall.<br /><br />
	<li>Make bath times as much fun for kiddies as a visit to the seaside by pouring a bucket of sand, a bag of salt and a dog turd into the bath.<br /><br />
	<li>Recreate the fun of a visit to a public swimming pool in your own home by filling the bath with cold water, adding two bottles of bleach,
	then urinating into it, before jumping in.<br /><br />
	<li>Girls. Too old to go on an 18 to 30 holiday? Simply get pissed, lie in a sand pit in your garden and shag every bloke who looks at you 
	over the fence.<br /><br />
	<li>Don't buy expensive 'ribbed' condoms, just buy an ordinary one and slip a handful of frozen peas inside it before you put it on.<br /><br />
	<li>X-Files fans. Create the effect of being abducted by aliens by drinking two bottles of vodka. You'll invariably wake up in a strange 
	place the following morning, having had your memory mysteriously 'erased'.<br /><br />
	<li>Don't waste money buying expensive binoculars. Simply stand closer to the object you wish to view.<br /><br />
	<li>Putting just the right amount of gin in your goldfish bowl makes the fishes' eyes bulge and cause them to swim in an amusing manner.<br /><br />
	<li>Save time when crossing a one-way street by only looking in the direction of oncoming traffic.<br /><br />
	<li>Thicken up runny low-fat yoghurt by stirring in a spoonful of lard.<br /><br />
	<li>Anorexics. When your knees become fatter than your legs, start eating cakes again.<br /><br />
	<li>A next door neighbour's car aerial, carefully folded, makes an ideal coat hanger in an emergency.<br /><br />
	<li>Hijackers. Avoid a long stressful siege and the risk of arrest, imprisonment or death by simply making sure you book a flight to 
	your intended destination in the first place.<br /><br />
	<li>An empty aluminium cigar tube filled with angry wasps makes an inexpensive vibrator.<br /><br />
	<li>Olympic athletes. Disguise the fact that you've taken anabolic steroids by running a bit slower. - B. Johnson, Canada.<br /><br />
	<li>Avoid arguments with the missus about lifting the loo seat by simply pissing in the sink.<br /><br />
	<li>Weedy fellas. Develop a right forearm like Arnold Schwarzeneggar by buying one of those Cindy Crawford workout videos.<br /><br />
	<li>Smokers. Save on matches and lighters, by simply lighting your next fag from the butt of your last one.<br /><br />
	<li>Vegetarians coming to dinner? Simply serve them a nice bit of steak or veal. Since they're always going on about how tofu, Quorn, 
	meat substitute etc 'tastes exactly like the real thing', they won't know any difference.<br /><br />
	<li>Invited by vegetarians out for dinner? Point out that since you'd no doubt be made aware of their special dietary requirements, tell 
	them about yours, and ask for a nice steak.<br /><br />
	<li>Spice up your sex life by trying a bit of 'rodeo sex'. Take your missus from behind and, holding on tightly to her jugs, call her by 
	the wrong name. See how long you can 'stay mounted' for.<br /><br />
	<li>Before attempting to remove stubborn stains from a garment always circle the stain in permanent pen so that when you remove the garment 
	from the washing machine you can easily locate the area of the stain and check that it has gone.<br /><br />
	<li>Give comics that 'Pulp Fiction' feel by reading the last frames of cartoons first, then reading the rest in a random order.<br /><br />
	<li>High blood pressure sufferers. Simply cut yourself and bleed for a while, thus reducing the pressure in your veins.<br /><br />
	<li>Heavy smokers. Don't throw away those filters from the end of your cigarettes. Save them up and within a few years you'll have enough 
	to insulate your loft.<br /><br />
	<li>Motorists. Enjoy the freedom of cycling by removing your windscreen, sticking half a melon skin on you head, then jumping red lights 
	and driving the wrong way up one way streets.<br /><br />
	<li>Create instant designer stubble by sucking a magnet and dipping your chin in a bowl of iron filings.<br /><br />
	<li>Convince neighbours that you have invented a 'SHRINKING' device by ruffling your hair, wearing a white laboratory coats and parking a 
	JCB digger outside your house for a few days. Then dim and flicker the lights in your house during the night and replacethe JCB unseen, with 
	a Tonka toy of the same description. Watch their faces in the morning!<br /><br />
	<li>Have all your dumps at work. Not only will you save money on toilet paper, but you'll also be getting paid for it.<br /><br />
	<li>Nissan Micra drivers. Attach a lighted sparkler to the roof of your car before starting a long journey. You drive the things like 
	dodgem cars anyway, so it may as well look like one.<br /><br />
	<li>A mouse trap, placed on top on of your alarm clock will prevent you from rolling over and going back to sleep.

<hr><b>C</b>inderella was now 75 years old.
<p>After a fulfilling life with the now departed Prince, she happily sat in her rocking chair watching the world go by with her cat Alan.
<p>One afternoon, out of nowhere, appeared her Fairy Godmother. Cinderella said, "Fairy Godmother, what are you doing here after all these years?"
<p>The Fairy Godmother replied, "Well Cinderella, since you have lived a good wholesome life since we last met, I have decided to grant you three wishes. Is there anything for which your heart still yearns?"
<p>Cinderella was overjoyed. "I wish I was extremely wealthy", she said. Instantly, her rocking chair turned into solid gold.
<p>Alan, her cat, jumped off her lap and ran to the edge of the porch quivering with fear. "Oh thank you Fairy Godmother," said Cinderella.
<p>"Is there anything else you might wish for", asked the Fairy Godmother.
<p>Cinderella looked down at her frail body, and said, "I wish I was young and full of the beauty I once had."
<p>At once, her wish was granted. Cinderella felt feeling inside her that she had not felt for years.
<p>The Fairy Godmother said, "you have one wish remaining, what shall you have?" Cinderella looked at her frightened cat in the corner and said, "I wish you turn Alan, my old cat, into a handsome young man."
<p>Magically, Alan suddenly underwent a change, and then before them stood a young man with the looks and body that no other man could match.
<p>The Fairy Godmother again spoke "Congratulations Cinderella. Enjoy your new life," and with that she was gone.
<p>For a few eerie moments, Cinderella and Alan looked into each other's eyes. Cinderella sat breathless, gazing at the most stunning perfect man she had ever seen. Then Alan walked over to Cinderella and held her close in his muscular arms. He leant in close to her ear and whispered in a warm breath, "bet you regret having my bollocks chopped off now, don't you?"

<hr><b>A</b> young man wanted to purchase a gift for his girlfriend's birthday and as they had not been dating for very long, he decided after careful consideration, that a pair of gloves would strike the right note. Thoughtful, but not too personal. Accompanied by his girlfriend's sister, he went to Harrods and bought a dainty pair of white gloves. The sister purchased a pair of panties for herself at the same time. During the wrapping, the shop assistant mixed up the items. The sister got the gloves and the young man got the panties. Without checking the contents, the young man sent the parcel to his girlfriend with the following note:

<p>Dear Daphne
<br>I chose these because you are not in the habit of wearing any when you go out in the evenings. If it had not been for your sister, I would have chosen the long ones with the buttons, but she wears short ones that are easier to remove. These are a delicate shade. The shop assistant I bought them from showed me the pair she had been wearing for the last 3 weeks and they were hardly soiled at all. I had her try yours on for me and although they were a little tight they looked really smart. She told me that the material helps to keep her ring clean and shiny. In fact she hasn't had to wash it since she began wearing them. I wish I could put them on for you, as no doubt, many other hands will touch them before I have a chance to see you again. When you take them off, remember to blow into them before putting them away as they will be naturally damp from wearing. Just think how many times my lips will kiss them in the coming year.

<p>I hope you will wear them for me on Friday night.

<p>Happy Birthday

<p>All my love

<p>Stuart

<p>PS The latest style is to wear them folded down with a little fur showing.

<hr><b>I</b>n a School science class four worms were placed into four separate jars.
<ul>

	<li>The second worm was put into a jar of cigarette smoke.

<hr>In the 16th and 17th centuries, everything had to be transported by ship. It was also before commercial fertiliser's invention, so large shipments of manure were common. It was shipped dry, because in dry form it weighed a lot less than when wet, but once water (at sea) hit it, it not only became heavier, but the process of fermentation began again, of which a by-product is methane gas.

<p>As the stuff was stored below decks in bundles you can see what could (and did) happen. Methane began to build up below decks and the first time someone came below at night with a lantern, BOOOOM!

<p>Several ships were destroyed in this manner before it was determined just what was happening. After that, the bundles of manure were always stamped with the term "Ship High In Transit" on them which meant for the sailors to stow it high enough off the lower decks so that any water that came into the hold would not touch this volatile cargo and start the production of methane.

<p>Thus evolved the term "S.H.I.T," which has come down through the centuries and is in use to this very day.

<p class="t-sml">(This is intended as humour, and is in fact total nonsense. The word actually comes from Old English (and German) and is found in similar form in many Germanic languages. See <a href="http://www.snopes.com/language/acronyms/shit.asp" target="_blank">Snopes</a> for the full etymology of the word.)</p>
