<hr><b>Introduction</b>
<p>Some older Strand dimmer units used a zero to -10V control signal, and the standard analogue control voltage is zero to +10V.&nbsp; This project allows the easy conversion from one standard to another.&nbsp; This is a very simple project, but may turn out to be a lifesaver for small theatre
groups and the like.</p>

<hr><b>Description</b>
<p>It has come to my attention that there are still a great many old Strand dimmers very much in use.&nbsp; The problem is that they are just too reliable, and won't go away ... but, they use a zero to -10V control signal, so are incompatible with the dimmer unit in these project pages, and with any new commercial analogue control console.

<p>In addition, there are no doubt quite a few old lighting consoles that use this standard, which means that they can't drive modern dimmer packs.&nbsp; As it turns out, a simple opamp inverter will convert either standard to the other.&nbsp; This is shown in Figure 1.</p>

<p>There is really nothing to it.&nbsp; Use as many circuits as needed, and a simple power supply (such as that in Project 05) will drive as many of these inverters as are likely to be required in any lighting setup.&nbsp; The above circuit has two channels, and may be simply repeated as many times as you need to get the required number of channels.&nbsp; The 100 ohm resistors on each output are there to prevent the opamps from oscillating when supplying a capacitive load (such as a coax cable).

<p>With an input of zero volts, the output will also be at zero volts.&nbsp; As the input increases (or decreases in the case of the -10V control) the output will change by exactly the same value, but in the opposite direction. <p>Wiring is not critical, the 1458 opamps specified are very cheap (but more than capable of doing the job), and they can be built very simply on Veroboard or similar.&nbsp; Supplies should be bypassed to common (ground) with 10uF electrolytic caps.</p>
