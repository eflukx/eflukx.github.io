<hr><b>Introduction</b>
<p>You need a power supply for a project, but only have a DC adapter available, so you can't use my AC power adapter trick (<a href="project05.htm">Project 05</a>).&nbsp; This little project
came about because a reader had just this problem, and didn't know what he could do.</p>

<p>This idea will work best with DC adapters having 12V DC or more - lower voltages will work, but the dynamic range will not be as good as it could be.&nbsp; For example - using a 12V DC supply you will get +/-6V, allowing a maximum signal level of about 2.8V (allowing for losses in the opamps).&nbsp; While this is still more than enough for most applications, it is generally better to have as much headroom
as possible.</p>

<p>The supply here will not be suitable for low level circuits (such as phono preamps), as these really do need lots of headroom, and hum might be a problem, since the standard plug-in power supply is not regulated.&nbsp; For high level applications, such as the surround decoder or a crossover filter, this circuit will allow you to use a supply you already have, saving a few dollars, pfennings, shekels (etc).&nbsp; The added capacitance should keep hum levels low, but you can increase the 1000uF caps if you want to ensure lower ripple.</p>

<p>There are two versions, one is ultra-simple, and is fine where there is no load imbalance - which is the majority of opamp circuits.&nbsp; Where there is a different current from +ve and -ve supplies, you will need to use the second circuit, which allows up to 30mA current imbalance between the supplies.</p>

<hr><b>Description</b>
<p>Circuits don't come much simpler than this.&nbsp; The input DC is given a voltage divider to establish a "virtual earth", and this is used as the 0V reference for the unit to be powered.&nbsp; In its simplest form, it uses a pair of resistors and two additional filter caps to make sure that the hum is within the capability of opamps to reject.&nbsp; This also provides a pair of properly decoupled supply rails to power the
circuit.&nbsp; As mentioned above, you can increase the 1000uF caps to get less hum, but it is not likely to cause a problem - opamps have very high power supply rejection, so even quite high hum levels on the supply will not be audible at the output.</p>

<br><b><small>Figure 1 - Simplest Form of the Circuit</small></b></center>

<p>There will be instances where the currents from each supply will be unequal.&nbsp; Where this is the case, the resistor divider is not sufficient, and the +ve and -ve voltages will be unequal.&nbsp;
By using a cheap opamp (such as a uA741), a DC imbalance between supplies of up to about 15mA will not cause a problem.&nbsp; However, we can do better with a dual opamp (which will cost the same or less anyway), and increase the capability for up to about 30mA of difference between the two supplies.</p>

<p>The 10 Ohm resistors (which can actually be almost any value that is handy from 10 to 100 Ohms) allow the opamps to share the load properly.&nbsp; Without these, one half of the amp (that with the higher gain) will do all the work, and the circuit will not work nearly as well.&nbsp; Opamp noise or other sonic characteristics are of no consequence, since their influence is completely swamped by the capacitance, so the circuit looks like a regular DC supply to the following circuitry.</p>

<p>Very simple, but works very well.&nbsp; I have used this technique many times in different designs, and it is extremely effective.&nbsp; I found that the circuit will keep the supply balanced with as much as 40mA of unbalanced load (i.e. with up to 40mA from +ve or -ve to ground), however, this is pushing the opamp right to its limits.</p>

<td>Note that there is no reverse polarity protection, since the diode voltage drop will reduce the limited voltage even further.&nbsp; If your supply is high enough in voltage (or the diode drop is not a problem for you), use a 1N4004 in series with the positive supply lead.
<p>Also, if a LED power indicator is to be used, make sure that it (and its series resistor) go between supply rails, and not to the artificial earth.&nbsp; <i>This is important </i>!</td>
