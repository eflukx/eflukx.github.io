<p>
<hr SIZE=3 WIDTH="100%"><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Introduction</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is the story from a reader, Richard
Lee.&nbsp; All photos and diagrams were supplied by Richard.&nbsp; As the
editor, I have added a couple of small comments, which are in bold, and
marked Ed. (As in editor :-).</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The text is pretty much verbatim, other
than reformatting to match my general page layout.</font>
<p>
<hr SIZE=3 WIDTH="100%"><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Motivation</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have fairly large collection of LPs
from the old days.&nbsp; They are just sitting in a box.&nbsp; I don't
intend to buy new LPs -- used ones maybe -- so I don't want to buy an expensive
phono preamp nor do I want to buy an expensive turntable.&nbsp; I do need
a phono preamp because my preamp does not have a phono section.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I obtained a used Sherwood turntable for
mere $30 U.S.&nbsp; I could have bought a phono preamp for some $100-150,
but that would have been NO FUN.&nbsp; I knew about ESP (Elliott Sound
Products) site since I was obsessed with trying to bi-amp my system.&nbsp;
(Yes, it is bi-amped with Rod's power-supply design + Marchand XM-1s.&nbsp;
More on that later, maybe.&nbsp; Rod's crossover required too many precision
capacitors and it turned out much simpler to just buy XM-1 kits from Marchand.)
<b><font size=-1>(Pity.&nbsp;
Ed.)</font></b></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Parts</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I had some trouble getting the parts.&nbsp;
Digikey's 1% metal-film resistors (Yageo) don't come in values I needed
for the phono-preamp.&nbsp; Thankfully, Mouser Electronics had them.&nbsp;
Bi-polar electrolytics were available from both vendors.&nbsp; I had some
left-over Burr-Brown 2604s so I decided to use them instead of NE5532.&nbsp;
All the other parts were obtained from Halted Surplus store.&nbsp; It's
a local store to me, so it was convenient.&nbsp; Also, since it is a surplus
store, things tend to be REALLY cheap.&nbsp; For example, the casing was
only $4.95!</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>(The OPA2604 is an excellent
opamp, and is highly recommended.&nbsp; Ed.)</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Building</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Power Supply</font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The power supply was actually the harder
part.&nbsp; Fitting those 4700uF caps is a pain!&nbsp; My first power supply
turned out to be a big mess.&nbsp; I got it to work and I am using it in
the
phono-preamp, but it really is a mess.&nbsp; My second power-supply for
the crossovers came out just about <u>infinite</u> times better looking.&nbsp;
Practice is definitely a good thing here.</font>

<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Figure 1 - Prototyping
Board Layout</font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As you can see in the picture, I used a
generic prototyping board with a fairly standard pattern.&nbsp; 4-3-3-4
holes with interlaced connections.&nbsp; I got pretty good at putting the
stuff onto this type of board.&nbsp; I used only 7 lines of the board with
the only repeating pad being the GND.&nbsp; It only requires 2 jumpers.&nbsp;
One for connecting two GND plains and one to go from 1st op-amp output
to 2nd op-amp input.&nbsp; I can't help that one, now can I?</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Bypass Capacitors (BP on the picture) aren't
really drawn as a pair, but you get the idea.&nbsp; Actually, I only used
one 10uF capacitor for bypassing instead of one 10uF &amp; 100nF.&nbsp;
I don't have any problems with it.&nbsp; I used one op-amp for each channel
instead of using two halves on each channel.&nbsp; The other channel is
perfect mirror image of the drawing.&nbsp; In fact, if I rotate the board
180 degrees, it looks the same way as before.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Other things to note</font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I came up with a clever and <font size=-1>CHEAP</font>
way of mounting the boards to the case.&nbsp; I bought a box of standard
screws and a box of nuts and used 1 screw + 3 nuts for each hole.&nbsp;
See picture.&nbsp; Neat, eh?</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="rl-p9f2.gif" ALT="Figure 2" BORDER=1 height=68 width=222>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Figure 2 - Board Mounting</font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For connections, power is permanent.&nbsp;
Inputs are jacks attached to the box.&nbsp; Those 3/4" holes were hard
to drill right.&nbsp; Outputs are internally soldered cables.&nbsp; They're
Monster Cable something or other.&nbsp; Interlink 400 or something like
that.&nbsp; I got them free with the CD player and I didn't need them,
so I cut one side and hardwired it to the preamp.</font>
<p>
<hr SIZE=3 WIDTH="100%"><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Some
Pictures and Stuff</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is the second power supply I made
for the crossovers.&nbsp; It is made with only the best components.&nbsp;
WAAAY overkill, but I'm only making one, so the cost wasn't a big issue.&nbsp;
Regulators are Motorola 7815ACT and 7915ACT.&nbsp; (ACT ones are the ones
with tighter tolerances.)&nbsp; 100nF caps are Panasonic polypropylene
2%.&nbsp; Rectifiers are "ultra-fast" something or other.&nbsp; TOTALLY
unnecessary, I know, but Digikey has $25 minimum order or they charge extra
5 dollars for handling.&nbsp; The hardest part was the two 4700uF 36V caps.&nbsp;
Big suckers they are.&nbsp; There are no 10uF nor 100uF caps here.</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="rl-p9f3.jpg" ALT="Figure 3" height=267 width=403>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Figure 3 - Power Supply</font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Crossovers themselves have 100uF caps at
their power inputs and the sample power-supply in the XM-1 instruction
manual didn't have them, so I figured it wouldn't cause me any problems.&nbsp;
Heat-sinks are not touching each other although it wouldn't matter since
they're insulated.&nbsp; When I play loud music, they do get pretty warm.</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="rl-p9f4.jpg" ALT="Figure 4" height=267 width=403>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Figure 4 - XM-1 Crossover</font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Here we have one of the XM-1 crossovers.&nbsp;
The input cable is Belden 89207 twin-axial cable with double shielding.&nbsp;
Nice looking cable.&nbsp; Other cables are all left-over Kimber 4TC speaker
cables unwinded.&nbsp; Obviously, all the interconnects are home-made.&nbsp;
I'm using Burr-Brown OPA2134's in the XM-1s.&nbsp; You might be able to
see the two 100uF caps near the power input.&nbsp; <b><font size=-1>(Hey
- what is this foreign crossover doing in my pages? Ed.)</font></b></font>

<p><img SRC="rl-p9f5.jpg" ALT="Figure 5" BORDER=0 height=267 width=403>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Figure 5 - Magnepan Speaker
(with operation scar)</font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Magnepan MG1.6QRs have internal crossovers
unlike MG3.6 and MG20, which have external boxes.&nbsp; I had to cut open
a slit and bypass the built-in crossovers.&nbsp; You can see the stitching
from the operation.&nbsp; No more warranty, but it was worth it!&nbsp;
I had to reverse the low input polarity because it was reversed due to
2nd order crossover's 180 degree phase shift.&nbsp; High-pass was 1st order.</font>

<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Figure 6 - Rear View
of Amplifier</font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">You can see the rear of one of my Bryston
amps and the connections.&nbsp; Nothing fancy.&nbsp; I love my Brystons
most among my equipment.&nbsp; Well, maybe I love my phono-preamp more
^_^ but nothing else really gives me 20 years unlimited warranty.</font>

Notes</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This information was compiled and submitted
by Richard, who has biamped his system, built my power supply and phono
preamp, and will (hopefully) build a few more things as well.&nbsp; This
information is provided as a service to others who might be contemplating
building stuff, but were put off by the lack of PCBs or whatever.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Richard has shown that it is not only possible,
but quite easy to do, as the photos and diagrams show.&nbsp; I do think
he is a brave man to attack a pair of Magnapans, but if you want it badly
enough, I guess anything is possible.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Brands and references to brands or suppliers
are as supplied by Richard.&nbsp; This is not an endorsement from me, nor
a criticism.&nbsp; I have simply used Richard's text.&nbsp; Any comments
