<hr><a id="intro"></a><b>Introduction</b>
<p>The speakers are complete, as described in <a href="sp-boxes.htm">Part 1</a> of this article.&nbsp; The next phase (actually completed some time ago now) was to finalise the Linkwitz Riley crossover, tweeter amp and re-establish my phono preamp.&nbsp; The idea was to make the final design a complement to the <a href="http://sound.au.com/vp103.htm" target="_blank">VP103</a> valve preamp, both in looks and function.

<p>To this end, one power switch now brings my preamp and all seven power amplifiers on-line (six for the stereo tri-amped speakers, and the sub-woofer amp).&nbsp; There are four amplifiers in my original power amp unit, a further two in the tweeter amp, and the separate sub amplifier. 

<p>All mains switching is performed in the tweeter amp unit, which has a 20A relay.&nbsp; This is powered from the 12.6V heater supply from the preamp - I added an extra output for the supply, and there is a corresponding input on the tweeter amp unit.&nbsp; There is zero power usage when the system is off.</p>

<hr><a id="desc"></a><b>Initial Assembly</b>
<p>Construction was not without difficulty.&nbsp; For example, neither the toroidal power transformer nor the heatsink would fit in a 1RU (1 "rack unit" is 44.45 mm, or 1 3/4 inches) rack case, so some modifications were performed so that they would.&nbsp; I was able to utilise many of my workshop "toys" to bring this project to fruition - always a good thing, since it justifies their purchase to SWMBO (She Who Must Be Obeyed :-)</p>

<center><img SRC="tw-base.jpg" ALT="Base of rack case" BORDER=1 height=294 width=640>
<br><b><small>Figure 1 - Base of the Rack Case</small></b></center>

<p>Figure 1 shows that there is a cutout for both heatsink and transformer, and both project about 10mm below the bottom of the case.&nbsp; The bottom plate was cut and bent to provide mounting flanges for the heatsink, and a separate panel was attached for the transformer. 

<center><p><img SRC="tw-top.jpg" ALT="Top of baseplate" BORDER=1 height=327 width=640>
<br><b><small>Figure 2 - Top View of Baseplate</small></b></center>

<p>In the view in Figure 2, the transformer can be seen, now recessed into its little cavity.&nbsp; The large screw to the left is for earthing.&nbsp; The power supply has been wired at this stage, and the filter caps were mounted on a piece of blank PCB material that I mechanically etched using a hand-held engraver unit.&nbsp; The power amplifier is actually the prototype of the Project 3A amplifier board - before I decided to extend the PCB for the output transistors.

<p>The supply voltage is +/-25V from a 120VA toroid, and the amp is used only above 3,500Hz, so loading is light, even at very high volume.&nbsp; As you shall see, the main supply is also used for the preamp power supply (Project 05), which powers all the smaller boards.</p>

<hr><a id="final"></a><b>Final Assembly</b>
<p>The next photos shows the unit in a very advanced stage - it is almost complete.&nbsp; All the circuit boards are wired and installed, as well as the switching module (bottom right) and muting relays (bottom centre).&nbsp; Standard IEC mains connectors are used for mains input and switched output, with all mains connections properly shrouded to prevent contact.</p>

<center><img SRC="tw-comp1.jpg" ALT="Rear view of unit" BORDER=1 height=333 width=640>
<br><b><small>Figure 3 - Rear View</small></b></center>

<p>The inscrutable box on the left side houses the phono preamp.&nbsp; Being high sensitivity, the last thing I wanted was hum or other noise, so complete shielding was the answer.&nbsp; It is also made with adjustable gain, since I use a (relatively) high output moving coil pickup most of the time.

<p>The earth connection for the turntable is on the extreme left of the rear panel.&nbsp; That is followed by phono inputs and outputs, and the gain switch.&nbsp; The next set of connectors is the input from the preamp, followed by midrange and low frequency outputs.&nbsp; The "ordinary" phono socket is for the DC switching voltage.&nbsp; The set of binding posts
/ banana sockets is for the tweeters - not surprisingly.</p>

<center><img SRC="tw-comp2.jpg" ALT="Front View" BORDER=1 height=305 width=640>
<br><b><small>Figure 4 - Front View</small></b></center>

<p>From the front, you can see the Linkwitz-Riley crossover - two boards stacked on top of each other on the extreme right.&nbsp; Just to the left is the power supply unit (Project 05), and you get a clearer look at the muting relay board (just right of centre at the top of the picture). 

<p>Although it all looks neat and tidy, there were a few stages where it looked like a rat's nest, while I moved wiring about to get the lowest noise levels.&nbsp; Because there is so much packed into a small case, this was not a simple task, and even moving a cable by a few millimetres made a substantial difference - especially the wiring to the tweeter amp
inputs.

<p>In this view, the power supply regulator is again visible, and no - the heatsinks do not touch each other, it just looks that way in the photo.&nbsp; They are actually held apart with a small dab of hot-melt glue, to make sure that they cannot short out.

<p>As you can see, there is no power switch, just one green LED on the front panel (plus the obligatory ESP logo, of course).</p>

<hr><a id="listen"></a><b>Listening Tests</b>
<p>The final listening tests with this system have been a true revelation.&nbsp; It is quite possibly the most revealing system I have heard, with nothing - ever - disappearing into the mix.&nbsp; Even at quite astonishing sound levels (about 110dB peak!), a violin does not tear out your ear drums and leave them bleeding on the floor.&nbsp; It just sounds like an incredibly loud violin.&nbsp; Other instruments fare equally well, as do vocals, both male and female.&nbsp; Normally though, I have found that my preferred (serious) listening level is most usually about 90dB (average unweighted), and often less.</p>

<blockquote>
<small>After some measurements, I can give the following (completely useless :-) information.&nbsp; For
an average listening level of 85dB SPL, I measure just under 3V at the midrange and woofer terminals - i.e. about 1W for each.&nbsp; The tweeter voltage is around 1V, or 125mW.&nbsp; From this, I deduce that the total power per speaker is about 2W on average - the tweeter power can be ignored as insignificant.&nbsp; With speaker efficiency of 90dB/W/m, this means that I have a room loss of about 10dB at the listening position, based on applied power versus measured SPL. (Listening distance is about 2.5 metres.)</small>
</blockquote>

<p>One thing that this system has highlighted is just how bad some recordings really are, and the artefacts of compressors and limiters (for example) are immediately audible.&nbsp; Although I prefer to listen to the music, rather than the recording technique or the system, sometimes it is just not possible when every flaw is revealed so clearly.&nbsp; As a result, I am re-assessing my CD and vinyl collection to some degree - in many cases to hear details that I have never noticed before.&nbsp; As always, there is a good and a bad side to having such a transparent system.

<p>In fact, the sound is so realistic, that from another room voices sound as if there are people in my lounge room.&nbsp; On more than one occasion, I have had to get up and see who was there when I am working in my study, only to find that it is just the TV, which (naturally!) is connected through the hi-fi as well.

<p>Overall, I am enormously satisfied with the speakers, crossover and indeed the complete system.&nbsp; It has not been a cheap exercise, but compared to the cost of purchasing a system that could come anywhere near it, I feel that I have a real bargain.</p>
