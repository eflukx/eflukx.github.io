<p><small>If you have a PayPal account, you can also pay using this means.&nbsp; For more information, to join PayPal, or to create an order and pay for it using PayPal, please click on the logo below.</small>

<p align="center"><a href="https://www.paypal.com/" target="_blank"><img SRC="paypal.gif" ALT="Make payments with PayPal - it's fast, free and secure!" BORDER=0 height=35 width=109></a></p>

<p><small>PayPal lets you pay anyone with an e-mail address and is the world's #1 online payment service - it's accepted on over 3 million eBay&trade; auctions and thousands of online shops.&nbsp; When you send money through PayPal, you can fund your payments with your credit card or cheque account.&nbsp; You won't have to worry about your privacy, because PayPal keeps your account information safe.<br><br>
<b>Prices shown in US$ are <i>only</i> for payment using PayPal.&nbsp; I have tried to strike a reasonable balance between the exchange rate, PayPal fees, and the need to constantly update the PCB pages.</b></small></p>
<p><b>Notes on using PayPal</b>
<br>When you order using PayPal, I don't need an order form. Just fill in the notes section in the PayPal "Send Money" page to include the following information ...
<table>
<tr><td><img src="filler.gif" alt=""></td>
<td><small>Your name and address (if different from that shown in the PayPal info)</small></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td><small> The list of boards you wish to purchase (with prices)</small></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td><small> The total amount for the boards (you will have to add this up yourself, sorry :-)</small></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td><small> Post and Handling charge is shown in the price list - you <i>must</i> add this to the total</small></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td><small>Send the PayPal cash to</small> <sub><img src="contact2.gif" alt="contact"></sub> <small>(my normal email address)</small></td></tr></table>
<p>Note that postage is <i>not</i> automatically added by PayPal - you must add postage to any PayPal order. &nbsp;PayPal's "automatic" shipping cost works sporadically, so has been disabled.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the total must be correct, and must agree with the amount being sent (including postage and handling).
