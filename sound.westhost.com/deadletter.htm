<hr><b>Dead Letters</b>

<p>Returned mail is very rare, but I do have the following parcels that have been paid for, but were returned
as "Unknown at Address" or similar.&nbsp; If you see your own name, then let me know - if you recognise someone
you know, then please let them know, and suggest they send an e-mail to advise the new address so I can send 
the parcels.</p>

<p>You will need to prove that you are the person who ordered the goods in the first place, so I will need some
kind of valid identification, and a fee of AU$12.00 (or US$10.00 via PayPal) will be required to re-pack and re-send
the PCBs.&nbsp; These boards will be held for a period of 2 (two) years from the date they are posted on this page. After that time, the boards will be forfeit.</p>

<table BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=3 width=800 align="center">
<tr><td><b>Recipient</b></td><td><b>City</b></td><td><b>Country</b></td><td><b>Date</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><small>None</small></td><td>&nbsp; </td><td>&nbsp; </td><td>&nbsp; </td></tr>
</table>

<p>Dates in red indicate that the 2 year holding period is over - the packages will be forfeit within 30 days of the update note above.&nbsp; Please note that if the address I am given is invalid for any reason, I will not spend hours chasing people's e-mail addresses to try to track down someone who has moved.&nbsp; I suggest that if you plan to move in the near future, your order should be postponed until you are settled in the new location.&nbsp; Alternatively, consider a Post Office Box - especially since they are traditionally far more secure than household mailboxes. Overseas mail can sometimes take longer than expected, so plan for this possibility if you can.</p>
