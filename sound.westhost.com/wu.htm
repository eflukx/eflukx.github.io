ESP accepts Western Union transfers for PCB purchase. Payments <b><i>must</i></b> be in Australian Dollars. All fees, charges taxes or other financial burdens must be paid by you when the money order is created. If fees or other charges are not paid, your order will be delayed until I have received the correct amount</small></p>

<p><small><b>Payments made in any currency other than AUD (Australian Dollars) will be rejected, and your order will not be filled !</b></small>

<p>When you order using Western Union, I don't need an order form. Just provide all the details of your purchase in an e-mail, and be sure to include the following information ...

<ul>
  <li><small>Your name and address</small></li>
  <li><small> The list of boards you wish to purchase (with prices)</small></li>
  <li><small> The total amount for the boards (you will have to add this up yourself, sorry :-)</small></li>
  <li><small> Post and Handling charge is shown in the price list - you <i>must</i> add this to the total</small></li>
  <li><small>Send the MTCN (Money Transfer Control Number)  and your order details to ESP</small></li>
</ul>

<p>Send the details to <sub><img src="contact2.gif" alt="Contact"></sub>

<p>Please note the following ...
<ul>
  <li>Postage must be added to the total, and if insurance is requested, this is <i>in addition</i> to the standard postage rate</li>
  <li>Your name <u><b>must</b></u> be exactly the same as that used when the money order was created</li>
  <li>The order will be posted to the address you supply ... if you send me the wrong address, the boards will be sent to the wrong address</li>
  <li>The total amount must be correct, and must agree with the amount being sent (including postage and handling).</li>
</ul>

If you are unsure of the amount you need to pay, please contact ESP first, and I will send you the total and any other details you may need.
