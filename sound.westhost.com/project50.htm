<hr><b>Introduction</b>
<p>So, a reader sends me an e-mail, and says ....</p>

<blockquote><font size=-1>Say, I am looking for a tone generator schematic.&nbsp; Specifically, one that is mounted on an "XLR" style plug, to test mic lines.&nbsp; These are great when installing multiple mic lines, to sort out which one is which; you can test the lines with only one person, too!&nbsp; Do you have one?&nbsp; It has got to be cheaper than buying one, and they can't be that difficult to build, can  they?&nbsp; Thanks!</font></blockquote>

<p>Well, it turns out I don't have one, but I could see the circuit in my head as I wrote the reply.&nbsp; Using my trusty opamp test board (see
<a href="project41.htm">Project 41</a>), I whipped it up in about 10 minutes.&nbsp; And here it is ....</p>

<hr><b>Description</b>
<p>This unit would be mounted in a small plastic or preferably metal box, with a 9V battery, level control, a male XLR connector (same as on a mic)
and a switch.&nbsp; Current drain is low, since the circuit only uses one dual opamp.&nbsp; There is no need for a high quality device, and a 1458
is all that is needed.</p>

<br><b><font size=-1>Figure 1 - Mic Circuit Test Oscillator</font></b></center>

<p>The first stage is the oscillator itself.&nbsp; This is a simple three stage phase shift oscillator - a circuit that is remarkably uncommon - which is to say I have never seen it used elsewhere.&nbsp; I designed it for another project a few years ago, and I don't understand why it is not
more common.

<p>If you want to tune it, you can use a 50k pot instead of R1.&nbsp; I suggest that if tuned, set it to A-440 Hz.&nbsp; Frequency stability is not wonderful, and it changes by a few Hertz as the battery discharges, but this is unlikely to cause problems - it is a test oscillator, not a tuning standard.&nbsp; As shown, frequency will be about 430Hz, depending on the accuracy of the capacitors.

<p>The phase shift network (R1-C1, R2-C2 and R3-C3) serves two purposes.&nbsp; First (and for an oscillator, most importantly), it shifts the phase of the output signal so the feedback is positive, causing oscillation.&nbsp; Secondly, since it is a three stage filter, it attenuates the signal and filters the output square wave so the signal at pin 2 is a reasonable sine wave.&nbsp; Distortion (if you really care) is about 3% or so - I didn't measure it this time, but I recall having done so before.

<p>The second stage is the output buffer, and the signal is simply split to supply the two mic leads.&nbsp; The metal case should be connected to pin 1 (earth) on the XLR connector.&nbsp; The output level control must be a linear type, as the circuit loading will create a good approximation to a log pot.&nbsp; Maximum output into a typical microphone input will be about 100mV (unloaded oscillator output on mine was 140mV).

<p>Not much to it - the whole circuit can be built on a small piece of veroboard, and the battery, pot and XLR connector will take up far more room than the oscillator.&nbsp; There is no LED indicator for power, as this would draw more current than the circuit.&nbsp; To prevent accidentally turning it on, a slide switch is suggested.&nbsp; They are a pig to mount compared to a toggle switch, but are much less easily bumped.&nbsp; If you can get a pot with a switch, this would be even better, but these are now hard to get - especially as linear.</p>

<td>Make sure that you do not connect any of the internal circuit to the case.&nbsp; As shown, the unit will be quite happy on phantom powered (48V) mic lines - this will not be true if you connect to the case.</td>
