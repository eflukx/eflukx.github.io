<p><a id="dll"></a><b>Windows DLL Files</b>
<br>If you get an error message at startup, it is probable that the Visual Basic runtime library is not installed on your computer.  The error message will be along the lines of 'ERROR starting Program. A required DLL file, VB40032.DLL was not found'.</p>
<p>For Windows 98 and ME, the DLL (Dynamically Linked Library) should be in the <i><b>\windows\system</b></i> folder, or <i><b>\windows\system32</b></i> for XP, NT or 2000. The executable programs will not run if this file is missing, or is in the wrong location.</p>
<p>For those souls who have tried in vain to get a copy of the Visual Basic DLL, visit ...
<br><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q196/2/86.asp">http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q196/2/86.asp</a>
<br>and select VB4run.exe as a download.&nbsp; Alternatively, download the <a href="http://www.annoyances.org/exec/software/vb4rt" target="_blank">VB40032.DLL</a> file from here.

<td><b><a href="StoreSetup.zip">STORES - StoreSetup.zip</a></b> (Compressed setup file - 291,866 bytes) The Stores program was written to replace my old stock management system, which was past its use-by date. Make sure you read the readme file (readme.txt). 
<p>Stores is a basic but extremely useful stock management program, that allows small manufacturers, repair shops and hobbyists to maintain a full database of all the parts they normally use. It is not limited to electronics, and can be used with anything, from tools, car parts to spares and finished goods in any industry. The version here is limited to a single database of 250 entries in a single database file, and has no reports (although the menu items are still there).
<p>The setup file is set up to use a directory C:\Program Files\Stores which will be created during the installation. Simply run SetupStores to extract the files.&nbsp; If you are upgrading, don't allow "parts.txt" to be overwritten! This is the default database file. By default, the SetupStores program will not overwrite the database or config files.
<p>The program may be registered (but see below first), which will get you a CD-ROM and unlimited downloads of updates and additional functionality. The full version supports unlimited database size, 5 separate database files, stock value and re-order reports, job files, and (possibly) more to come. 
<p>Both versions of the program have extensive help, and use a simple text database format. Even without indexing, a search on a 32,000 record database takes about 2 seconds on a Pentium 666MHz machine.
<p><b><small>Note:</small></b> &nbsp; Registration is currently not available - the program is being updated (very slowly, unfortunately), and registration will be available when the new version is finally complete.<!--AU$40.00 (US$29.00), and includes a CD-ROM with the latest version and as a bonus also includes the ESP construction articles. The CD-ROM also contains the key to unlock future downloads.--></td></tr></table>

There are two extracted files - <small>ESP-TRAN.EXE</small> and <small>BIPOLAR.TXT</small>, being the executable and database respectively. <small>ESP-SEMI.EXE</small> may be deleted after extraction unless you want to give a copy to someone else. New stuff can be added as you find the data. If you add a lot of stuff, feel free to e-mail me a copy of the new database (compressed, <i>please</i>!), and I will add it to the database file. 
<p>For users who eschew Windows, the text file is still useful, as it can be read with any text editor or even a spreadsheet (<small>TAB</small> delimited format). Be careful with spreadsheets, as they like to try to convert some data into dates (really useful - not!).</td></tr></table>

<p>Make sure that you create a shortcut in your startup folder, and you will be reminded each time you log in or start your computer. When you first run the program, click on "Edit" quickly (the program will exit by itself in 10 seconds if there is nothing for that day). Read the help info in the supplied demo file, delete the things you don't want, and enjoy.</td></tr></table>
