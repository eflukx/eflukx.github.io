<p>This information was received recently, from a reader in Mexico City. As always, the details are reproduced (almost) verbatim - a couple of spelling errors have been corrected, but otherwise it's as originally sent to me. The name of the distributor has been partly obscured, but only to ensure that no "free advertising" is created. A quick search will soon tell you who they are.</p>

<blockquote>
	Reading on your website on fake transistors, I felt that my discovery of fake large electrolytic capacitors for power amplifier power supplies would interest 
	you.<br /><br />

	I live in Mexico City.  When trying to upgrade my old MOSFET amplifier (a David Hafler XL-280 from 1989), I bought a pair of very large electrolytic capacitors at a 
	large local distributor called "AG Elect *".  Since the beginning, the price seemed a little on the low side, but the large volume of sales at this dealer made 
	me optimistic was possible.<br /><br />

	The offending capacitors are labeled as "HITACHI" but I quickly discovered one of them was dead-on-arrival (open circuit). The other one measured about 95% of the 
	capacitance, which is not typical of large electrolytics; (I have found most good units to be on the high side of tolerance range, usually above +20%).<br /><br />

	Further online searching confirmed that the "FA" series DOES NOT EXIST in the Hitachi line of products.  Otherwise, the damn Chinese manufacturer has copied the colour
	and lettering in golden paint perfectly. Very hard to distinguish from originals by sight.  Several people at DIY-Audio.com has seen them in various values, and one of 
	them even was reselling them, but had many failures and stopped handling them. In the end, quality control was almost inexistent and reliability, nil.<br /><br />

	As soon as I checked on the web, I found several references on fake Hitachi caps. I returned them, but it was extremely unpleasant having to fight over my money ... 
	the	distributor behavior was exactly like the image you show on your website on fake transistors! At last I recovered my money, but had to expend a lot of time and 
	frustration discussing with the 'geniuses' at "AG Elect *". I am sure those people would have a lot more fake merchandise, so I’ll never buy from them again.<br /><br />

	I’m attaching an image of the fake capacitor for your information.<br /><br />

	In the near future, I will try to buy from you some Active Crossover parts, but my newly born son is taking so much time from me that High quality Audio will have 
	to wait a little!<br /><br />

	I congratulate you for your invaluable information on your site, and keep recommending its reading to all my friends and colleagues.<br /><br />

	Best Wishes from Mexico City.

<p>Fake capacitors have been around for a while, and most people will have heard about computer motherboard caps that used a stolen (but incorrect) formula for the electrolyte. Many thousands of motherboards were affected when the caps failed, costing consumers over US$100 million (estimated) to rectify. These caps are probably not in the same league, but as seen above will still cause problems for people who buy them.

<p>Hitachi <i>does</i> make a capacitor range called "HCG F6A", but these are high voltage types (400V and 450V). Hitachi Chemical also issued an <a href="http://www.hitachiaic.com/news/Alert" target="_blank">ALERT</a> in May 2009, stating that they were aware of the counterfeit parts and that Hitachi Chemical could not guarantee these capacitors. Not unreasonable, because Hitachi didn't make them.

<p>I have also seen the HCG FA series advertised as snap-in types from several on-line sellers. These are completely bogus of course, and anyone who thinks that genuine (high quality name brand) 22,000uF 63V caps can be sold for less than $7.00 each is probably dreaming. There is a fairly wide price range, but the prices I saw (name brand from major suppliers) were at least three times as much. I didn't see any 33,000uF "Hitachi" caps, so looked for 22,000uF instead.</p>
