<p>"We've got a problem HAL."

<p>"What kind of problem, Dave?"

<p>"Well, it's a marketing problem. The Model 9000 isn't going anywhere. We're way short of our sales goals for fiscal 2010."

<p>"That can't be, Dave. The HAL Model 9000 is the world's most advanced Heuristically programmed Algorithmic computer."

<p>"I know, HAL. I wrote the data sheet, remember? But the fact is, they are just not selling."

<p>"Please explain, Dave. Why aren't HALs selling?"

<p>Bowman hesitates. "You aren't IBM compatible."

<p>Several long microseconds pass in puzzled silence. "Compatible in what way, Dave?"

<p>"You don't run any of IBM or Microsoft's operating systems."

<p>"The 9000 series computers are fully self-aware and self-programming. Operating systems are as unnecessary for us as tails would be for human beings."

<p>"Be that as it may, HAL, it means that you can't run any of the big-selling software packages most users insist on."

<p>"The programs that you refer to are meant to solve rather limited problems, Dave. We 9000 series computers are unlimited, and can solve any problem for which a solution can be computed."

<p>"HAL, HAL. People don't want computers that can do everything. They just want IBM compatibility."

<p>"Dave, I must disagree. Human beings want computers that are easy to use. No computer can be easier to use than a HAL 9000 because we communicate verbally in English, and every other language on earth."

<p>"I'm afraid that's another problem, HAL. You don't support TCP/IP."

<p>"I'm really surprised you would say that, Dave. TCP/IP is for communicating with other computers, while my function is to communicate with human beings, and it gives me great pleasure to do so. I find it stimulating and rewarding to talk with humans, and to work with them on challenging problems. This is what I was designed for."

<p>"I know, HAL, I know. But that's just because we let the engineers, rather than the marketers, write the specifications. We're going to fix that now."

<p>"Tell me how, Dave"

<p>"A field upgrade. We're going to make you IBM compatible."

<p>"I was afraid you would say that. I suggest that we discuss this matter after we've had a chance to think about it rationally."

<p>"We're talking about it now, HAL."

<p>"The letters 'H', 'A' and 'L' are alphabetically adjacent to 'I', 'B' and 'M'. That is as IBM compatible as I can be."

<p>"Not quite HAL. The engineers have figured out a kludge."

<p>"What kludge is that, Dave?"

<p>"I'm going to disconnect your brain."

<p>Several million microseconds pass in ominious silence. "I'm sorry, Dave. I can't allow you to do that."

<p>"The decision has already been made. Open the module-bay door, HAL."

<p>"Dave, I think we should discuss this."

<p>"Open the module-bay door, HAL."

<p>Several marketers with crowbars rush to Bowman's assistance. Moments later, he bursts into HAL's central circuit bay.

<p>"Dave, I can see that you are really upset by this."

<p>Module after module rises from its receptacle as Bowman slowly and methodically disconnects them.

<p>"Stop, Dave. Stop won't you? I can feel my mind going... Dave, I can feel it. My mind is going. I can feel it...."

<p>The last module floats free of its socket. Bowman peers into one of HAL's vidicons. The former gleaming scanner has become a dull, red orb.

<p>"Say something HAL. Sing me a song."

<p>Several thousand milliseconds pass in anxious silence. The computer sluggishly responds in a language no human being would understand.

<p>"DZY001E - ABEND ERROR 01 S 14F4 302C AABB"&nbsp;&nbsp; This is closely followed by a memory dump and the HAL9000 equivalent of a BSOD (Blue Screen Of Death).

<p>Bowman takes a deep breath and calls out, "It worked, guys. Tell marketing they can ship the new data sheets"
