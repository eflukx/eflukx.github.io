<b>DF100 Digital Camera Slave Flash Trigger</b>
<p>Many of the popular digital cameras used today feature a "pre-flash" which
the camera uses to calculate the white balance.&nbsp; The pre-flash is typically
100ms (100 milliseconds, or 1/10th second) before the main flash, and if you
have an investment in your "pre-digital" slave flash units, these are rendered
virtually obsolete if your new camera uses pre-flash. Conventional light
triggered slave units will not work with any digital camera that uses pre-flash.&nbsp;
All such slave units will fire on the pre-flash and and they cannot cycle
quickly enough to fire again when the picture is taken 100 ms later.<br>
<br>
For underwater use, most of the "on camera" flash units do not have a sufficient
output to illuminate the scene (approx 2/3 reduction in flash effectiveness
v distance).&nbsp; There is another problem - "Backscatter", where the "on
board" camera flash illuminates the nearer (out of focus) particulate in the
water column between the camera and the subject, this reflects back into the
camera and renders the frame useless.&nbsp; A decidely non-useless frame is shown
<a href="#eel">below</a> to give you an idea of the capability if the system.<br>
</p>
<p>Most new housing / strobe manufacturers currently use an optically triggered
device for digital cameras, housings using a watertight connector such as
the standard Nikonos fittings are rare. The DF100 offers existing photographers
who use a film medium and have strobes / slaves that will fire on a single
strobe pulse a significant opportunity to protect the investment that they
already have ($$$$).<br>
<br>
The DF100 module is designed to fire your existing low voltage trigger strobe
units on the second flash, when the camera actually takes the photo.&nbsp;
It does this by ignoring the first flash, and only triggering the external
strobe on the second flash from the camera.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Although originally designed for underwater photography, the DF100 is just
as useful on dry land, the only difference being the housing required.&nbsp;
Indeed, for use in a studio or other indoor activities, it can be used with
no housing at all.<br>
<br>
The DF100 module is available as a bare unit that you can install in any housing
you choose, in a standard casing, or in a waterproof housing (to 40 metres
depth). &nbsp;In all cases, there is no connector supplied, as the range
is too great. &nbsp;The standard lead supplied is 1 metre of 2-core shielded
cable with housed units, and for modules there are 3 pins for attachment of
the lead (and an optional battery).<br>
<br>
Depending on your flash unit, the DF100 will normally be powered directly
from the flash itself, requiring no external power source.&nbsp; Where the
available power is too low, the module can be powered from a 6V camera battery,
which will last for almost the shelf life of the battery, provided a suitable
cap is placed over the photo sensor.<br>
<br>
Note that the unit is polarity sensitive, and will only work with strobe flashes
using low voltage triggering (typically 12V or thereabouts).&nbsp; If it
does not work, then simply reverse the polarity of the connection to your
strobe.<br>
<br>
High voltage triggering (300-400V) is not available at this time, but may
be offered if there is sufficient demand.&nbsp; Connection of the DF100 to
a high voltage strobe will damage the circuitry, and any such damage is not
covered by any warranty.</p>
<p><b><font size="-1">The module described is not a kit - it has been completely
built and tested, and all major specifications are verified for each unit.</font></b><br></p>
<hr width="100%" size="3"><b>Features</b><br>
<p>The DF100 is a slave flash synchronisation unit that triggers the external
strobe on the second flash from a digital camera.&nbsp; Should a "stray" flash
or burst of light hit the photo sensor, it will automatically reset in approximately
700ms.&nbsp; This prevents the unit from remaining in an "invalid" state,
which would allow it to trigger on the next flash it received (the camera
pre-flash).&nbsp; When the DF100 resets itself, it will trigger the strobe
- this is quite normal.<br>
<br>
The output of the DF100 is three wires - common, external power (typically +6 to +12V)
and a trigger lead.&nbsp; For many flash units, the power and trigger leads
can simply be joined together, and no battery will be required.&nbsp; Standby
current drain is extremely low, so even if a battery is used, a switch is
not necessary.<br>
<br>
The sensor will not react to normal lighting, but in some cases you may find
that it is still too sensitive, and does not allow the strobe flash to operate.&nbsp;
It may be made less sensitive by using an infra-red filter, or a piece of
exposed colour slide film.&nbsp; In many cases, a cardboard shield will be
sufficient to shield the DF100 from nearby bright lighting.<br>

<br>
In the photo above, the three pins for connection are clearly shown.  The upper pin is power, centre pin is the trigger 
(these will usually be connected together), and the lower pin is ground (negative).  The photo sensor may be angled to 
suit your application when you buy the module by itself.</p>
<p>The DF100 flash trigger units are supplied with full documentation, showing
the typical connections required.&nbsp; Under normal circumstances, a separate
battery is not needed, but provision is made for one with the standard leads or the bare module.&nbsp; Should your
flash unit not be able to power the DF100, you will need to use the DF100 with an external battery,
or supply your own housing with sufficient space for a battery.<br>

<p>The DF100/M is available now, and payment is accepted by credit card (Mastercard, Visa or Bankcard in Australia),
PayPal or Paymate.  The the others will follow as soon as I can get the housings finalised.<br><br>
The DF100/M is 13mm x 40mm in size, excluding the sensor (an extra 10mm, approximately).&nbsp; Being so small,
it is easy to attach to any camera (with the sensor "viewing" the camera's on-board flash), and may be attached using
Velcro<sup><small>TM</small></sup> or similar.<br>
<br>
This is a unique product, and to my knowledge there is only one similar unit
available.&nbsp; The competing system does not have the ability to be self
powered, is physically very much larger, and is considerably more expensive.&nbsp;
It is also unsuited to underwater photography.<br>
<br>
The flexibility of the DF100 is enhanced by your ability to purchase the module
without a housing, as this means that by bending the leads to the sensor,
it can be tailored to suit the mounting method most appropriate for your
needs.&nbsp; The standard unit is supplied as end-sensitive (i.e. the end
of the DF100 faces the camera flash).&nbsp; With little effort, it can be
made side-sensitive, so it can stand upright.&nbsp; The instructions supplied
describe how the sensor can even be removed and attached to a wire (up to
400mm in length) for even greater flexibility.</p>
<hr width="100%" size="3"><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Limited Warranty</font></b>
<p>The DF100 (in any form) is unconditionally guaranteed for a period of
one year from date of purchase, and will be replaced immediately if it should
fail due to faulty materials or workmanship.&nbsp; Damage caused by water
leakage (if you supply your own housing), connection to a high voltage strobe
head, or physical damage is not covered.<br>
<br>
Full warranty details are supplied with the unit. &nbsp;The supplied module
is warranted to be free of manufacturing defects or other faults in materials
or workmanship, including damage sustained in transit from ESP to the purchaser.&nbsp;
Limitations on this warranty are based on the fact that ESP has no control
over the final disposition of the unit, or that it has been correctly wired
and mounted, and operated in accordance with the supplied instructions.&nbsp;
Units that have been used in excess of any absolute maximum parameter (as
detailed above) or have been incorrectly wired (for example to a high voltage
trigger circuit) or have been damaged or tampered with are not covered by
this warranty.</p>
<p>If used completely within the ratings, the module is covered by a 12 month
repair or replacement warranty, provided that it is returned properly packed,
and intact and unmodified in any way.&nbsp; ESP reserves the right to deny
warranty claims if it is determined that the fault was caused by excess voltage,
tampering of any kind, PCB or component physical damage (other than damage
in transit from ESP to the purchaser).&nbsp;</p>
<p>A repair service is available for units that have been damaged, but it
is at the discretion of ESP as to repair an existing unit or replace it completely
(depending on the damage sustained).</p>

<p>The photo below was taken using a typical high-end digital camera, and used the DF100
to trigger the external strobe flash.&nbsp; The image resolution has been reduced for the 
web, but this gives you an idea of the clarity and sharpness available.</p>
<center><img src="df100pic.jpg"></center>
<p>This photo was taken in a small cave just outside Sydney Harbour, at a depth of about 
25 metres.&nbsp; With the camera's on-board flash, this photo would have been unusable,
but as you can see, it is anything but!&nbsp; My thanks to Chris Partridge for the image,
which was taken using the production prototype of the DF100 trigger unit.</p>
