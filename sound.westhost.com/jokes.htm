<u><b>T</b>he battle of the sexes continues ...</u>
<p>HE SAID ... SHE SAID
<p>He said... Want a quickie?
<br>She said... As opposed to what?
<p>He said... I don't know why you wear a bra - you've got nothing to put in it.
<br>She said... You wear briefs, don't you?
<p>He said... Do you love me just because my father left me a fortune?
<br>She said... Not at all honey, I'd love you no matter who left you the money.
<p>She said...What do you mean by coming home half drunk?
<br>He said... It's not my fault - I ran out of money.
<p>He said... Since I first laid eyes on you, I've wanted to make love to you in the worst way.
<br>She said... Well, you succeeded.
<p>He said... If you only could learn to make me a proper meal, then
we could manage without the cook. And if you cleaned the house, we could
fire the maid as well.
<br>She said... Darling, if you only could learn to satisfy me properly
we could do without the gardener too.
<p>He said... Two inches more, and I would be king.
<br>She said... Two inches less, and you'd be a queen.
<p>On wall in ladies room: 'My husband follows me everywhere'
<br>Written just below it: 'I do not'
<p>He said... What have you been doing with all the grocery money I gave you?
<br>She said... Turn sideways and look in the mirror.
<p>He said... Let's go out and have some fun tonight.
<br>She said... Okay, but if you get home before I do, leave the hallway light on.
<p>He said... Why don't you tell me when you have an orgasm?
<br>She said... I would, but you're never there.
<p>He said... Every time women look at me, they can't help thinking of sex.
<br>She said... Yeah, 'cause you look like a prick.
<p>He said... Shall we try a different position tonight?
<br>She said... That's a good idea.... you stand by the ironing board while I sit on the sofa and fart.

<hr><b>A</b> friend swears black and blue that this is true, and says it happened to his father (a gent of Eastern European decent with limited English). One day he's walking his small dog in a park (no leash - tsk, tsk) and the dog takes an instant dislike to another chap sitting on a park bench. It rushes over to the poor fellow and starts gnawing on his leg. Being a small dog the expected damage was limited, but it caused the expected reaction from the man.
<p>My friend's father rushes over and cries "What for you kick it my dog, and call him Fuckoff?"</p>
<p>This unleashes a stream of invective from the attacked man, hurling insults (in Australian vernacular) covering the dog, its owner, both dog and owner's ancestors, country of origin, parental status and anything else he could think of.  It is worth noting that a stream of Aussie vernacular insults is pretty much unintelligible - even to other Aussies - often even to the person hurling the insults. <img src="grin.gif"></p>
<p>My friend's father was totally and understandably perplexed, not having understood a bloody word of what has been said. He said innocently "What is this? I ask it you sensible, you tell it me non-sensible."</p>
<p>I never did believe that it was true, but it <i>does</i> make a great story.</p>

<hr><b>S</b>herlock Holmes and Dr Watson went on a camping trip. After a good meal and a bottle of wine they lay down for the night, and went to Sleep. Some hours later, Holmes awoke and nudged his faithful friend.
<p>"Watson,look up at the sky and tell me what you see."
<p>Watson replied, "I see millions and millions of little stars."
<p>"What does that tell you?" Watson pondered for a minute.
<p>"Astronomically, it tells me that there are millions of galaxies and potentially billions of planets.
<br>Astrologically, I observe that Saturn is in Leo.
<br>Horologically, I deduce that the time is a approximately a quarter past three.
<br>Theologically, I can see that God is all powerful and that we are small and insignificant.
<br>Meteorologically, I suspect that we will have a beautiful day tomorrow. What does it tell you?"
<p>Holmes was silent for a minute, then spoke. "Watson, you're a dickhead. Some bastard has stolen our tent."

<hr><b>A</b> blonde is terribly overweight, so her doctor puts her on a diet. "I want you to eat regularly for two days, then skip a day, and repeat this procedure for two weeks. The next time I see you, you'll have lost at least five pounds." When the blonde returns, she's lost nearly 20 pounds.
<p>"Why, that's amazing!" the doctor says. "Did you follow my instructions?" 
<p>The blonde nods. "I'll tell you, though, I thought I was going to drop dead that third day."
<p>"From hunger, you mean?"
<p>"No, from skipping."

<hr><b>A</b> blonde tried to sell her old car. She was having a lot of problems selling it, because the car had 250,000 miles. One day, she told her problem to a brunette she worked with her at a salon.
<p>The brunette told her, "There is a possibility to make the car easier to sell, but it's not legal."
<p>"That doesn't matter," replied the blonde, "if I only can sell the car."
<p>"Okay," said the brunette. "Here is the address of a friend of mine. He owns a car repair shop. Tell him I sent you and he will turn the counter in your car back to 50,000 miles. Then it should not be a problem to sell your car any more."
<p>The following weekend, the blonde made the trip to the mechanic. About one month after that, the brunette asked the blonde, "Did you sell your car?"
<p>"No," replied the blonde, "why should I, the car only has 50,000 miles on it."

<hr><b>S</b>o there's this blonde out for a walk. She comes to a river and sees another blonde on the opposite bank. "Yoohoo" she shouts, "how can I get to the other side?"
<p>The second blonde looks up the river then down the river then shouts back, "You are on the other side."

<hr><b>O</b>n a plane bound for New York, the flight attendant approached a blonde sitting in the first class section
and requested that she move to coach since she did not have a first class ticket.
<p>The blonde replied, "I'm blonde, I'm beautiful, I'm going to New York, and I'm not moving."
<p>Not wanting to argue with a customer, the flight attendant asked the co-pilot to speak with her. He went to talk with the woman asking her to please move out of the first class section.
<p>Again, the blonde replied, "I'm blonde, I'm beautiful, I'm going to New York, and I'm not moving." The co-pilot returned to the cockpit and asked the captain what he should do.
<p>The captain said, "I'm married to a blonde, and I know how to handle this." He went to the first class section and whispered in the blonde's ear.
<p>She immediately jumped up and ran to the coach section mumbling to herself, "Why didn't anyone just say so?"
<p>Surprised, the flight attendant and the co-pilot asked what he said to her that finally convinced her to move from her seat. He said, "I told her the first class section wasn't going to New York."

<hr><b>A</b> businessman and his secretary, overcome by passion, go to his house for an early afternoon "quickie." "Don't worry," he purrs. "My wife is out of town on a business trip, so there's no risk."
<p>As one thing leads to another, the woman reaches into her purse and suddenly gasps, "We have to stop, I forgot to bring birth control!"
<p>"No problem," her lover replies. "I'll get my wife's diaphragm." After a few minutes of searching, he returns to the bedroom in a fury.
<p>"That witch!" he exclaims. "She took it with her! I always knew she didn't trust me!"

<hr><b>A</b> man took his wife to a Broadway show. During the first intermission he had to take a leak in the meanest way, so he hurried to find the bathrooms. He searched in vain for the bathrooms, but he finally found a beautiful fountain with foliage, and nobody was watching, so he decided to take a leak right there. 
<p>When he finally got back into the auditorium, the second act had already begun. He searched in the dark until he found his wife. "Did I miss much of the second act?" he asked. "Miss it?" she said, "You were in it!"

<hr><b>W</b>hilst enjoying a drink with a mate one night, this bloke decides to try his luck with an attractive young girl sitting alone by the bar. To his surprise, she asks him to join her for a drink and eventually asks him if he'd like to come back to her place.
<p>The pair jump into a taxi and as soon as they get back to her flat they dive onto the bed and spend the night hard at it. Finally, the spent young bloke rolls over, pulls out a cigarette from his jeans and searches for his lighter.
<p>Unable to find it, he asks the girl if she has one at hand. "There might be some matches in the top drawer," she replies.
<p>Opening the drawer of the bedside table, he finds a box of matches sitting neatly on top of a framed picture of another man.
<p>Naturally, the bloke begins to worry. "Is this your husband?" he inquires nervously.
<p>"No, silly," she replies, snuggling up to him.
<p>"Your boyfriend then?"
<p>"No, don't be daft," she says, nibbling away at his ear.
<p>"Well, who is he then?" demands the bewildered bloke.
<p>Calmly, the girl takes a match, strikes it across the side of her face and replies, "That's me before the operation."

<hr><b>A</b>fter a preacher died and went to heaven, he noticed that a New York cab driver had been awarded a higher place than he.
<p>"I don't understand," he complained to Saint Peter. "I devoted my entire life to my congregation." "Our policy here in Heaven is to reward results," Saint Peter explained. "Now, was your congregation well attuned to you whenever you gave a sermon?"
<p>"Well," the minister had to admit," some in the congregation fell asleep from time to time."
<p>"Exactly," said Saint Peter. "And when people rode in this man's taxi, they not only stayed awake, they even prayed."

<hr><b>N</b>oticing that her boss' fly was open, the embarrassed secretary told him, "Your garage door is open."
<p>The bewildered exec didn't know what she meant at first until she pointed. He quickly zipped up and said, "I hope you didn't see my super deluxe Cadillac."
<p>"Nope." she replied. "Just an old pink Volkswagen with 2 flat tyres.

<hr><b>A</b> blonde and her girlfriend went to the beach for the day. As they wandered up and down the shoreline in their bikinis the girlfriend began to notice that the blonde seemed to be having some difficulty walking.
<p>The girlfriend finally said, "Did you hurt your leg or something? You're walking very strangely."
<p>The blonde replied, "I have a big date tonight and I've got curlers in my hair."

<hr><b>A</b>n architect, an artist and an engineer were discussing whether it was better to spend time with the wife or a mistress.
<p>The architect said he enjoyed time with his wife, building a solid foundation for an enduring relationship.
<p>The artist said he enjoyed time with his mistress, because of the passion and mystery he found there.
<p>The engineer said, "I like both."
<p>"Both?"
<p>"Yeah. If you have a wife and a mistress, they will each assume you are spending time with the other woman, and you can go to the lab and get some work done."

<hr><b>A</b> man walks into an antique store, and starts looking around. All of the sudden he spies a huge BRASS RAT in the corner. He falls in love with it, and so he takes it to the cashier.
<p>"The rat, eh?" says the old grizzly cashier "um, yeah...how much?" replies our friend "Well, five bucks for the rat -- but 200 dollars for the story," he replied. "I'll just take the rat, without the story." Says the customer.
<p>He leaves the store, his precious brass rat tucked under his arm. Soon he begins to notice that a few rats are following him. He walks a few more blocks and the number of rats behind him increased. This continued, until there were virtually millions of rats behind him.
<p>Afraid of this mass following the man ran to the sea and threw the rat in. All of the rats plunged in after it, and met their watery deaths.
<p>The man ran back to the antique store. The old cashier was chuckling to himself. "So now do you want the story?" "No," said the man, "but have you got any brass lawyers?"

<hr><b>I</b>t was about a month ago when a Dutchman in Amsterdam felt that he needed to confess, so went to his priest.
<p>"Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. During W.W.II I hid Jewish man in my attic."
<p>"Well," answered the priest, "that's not a sin."
<p>"But I made him agree to pay me 20 Gulden for every week he stayed."
<p>"I admit that wasn't good, but you did it for a good cause."
<p>"Oh thank you Father; that eases my mind. Er, I have one more question..."
<p>"What is that, my son?"
<p>"Do I have to tell him the war is over?"

<hr><b>T</b>he pretty teacher was concerned with one of her eleven-year-old students. Taking him aside after class
one day, she asked, "Little Johnny, why has your school work been so poor lately?"
<p>"I'm in love," the boy replied. Holding back an urge to smile, she asked, "With whom?"
<p>"With you," he said.
<p>"But Johnny," she said gently, "don't you see how silly that is? It's true that I would like a husband of my own some day. But I don't want a child."
<p>"Oh, don't worry," the boy said reassuringly, "I'll use a rubber."

<hr><b>T</b>he Queen Elizabeth Medical Centre is reporting an unusual occurrence in the Obstetrics department: a child was born with both male and female organs. A penis and a brain.

<hr><b>O</b>ne day a cat dies of natural causes and goes to heaven. There he meets the Lord Himself. The Lord says to the cat "you lived a good life and if there is any way I can make your stay in Heaven more comfortable, please let Me know". The cat thinks for a moment and says "Lord, all my life I have lived with a poor family and had to sleep on a hard wooden floor." The Lord stops the cat and says "say no more" and a wonderful fluffy pillow appears.
<p>A few days later 6 mice are killed in a tragic farming accident and go to heaven. Again there is the Lord there to great them with the same offer. The mice answer "All of our lives we have been chased. We have had to run from cats, dogs and even women with brooms. Running, running, running; we're tired of running. Do you think we could have roller skates so we
don't have to run any more?" The Lord says "say no more" and fits each mouse with beautiful new roller skates.
<p>About a week later the Lord stops by to see the cat and finds him snoozing on the pillow. The Lord gently wakes the cat and asks him "How are things since you are here?" The cat stretches and yawns and replies "It is wonderful here. Better than I could have ever expected. And those 'Meals On Wheels' you've been sending by are the best"

<hr><b>T</b>here was an engineer who had an exceptional gift for fixing all things mechanical. After serving his company loyally for over 30 years, he happily retired. Several years later the company contacted him regarding a seemingly impossible problem they were having with one of their multi-million dollar machines.
<p>They had tried everything and everyone else to get the machine fixed, but to no avail. In desperation, they called on the retired engineer who had solved so many of their problems in the past.
<p>The engineer reluctantly took the challenge. He spent a day studying the huge machine. At the end of the day, he marked a small "x" in chalk on a particular component of the machine and proudly stated, "This is where your problem is".
<p>The part was replaced and the machine worked perfectly again. The company received a bill for $50,000 from the engineer for his service.
<p>They demanded an itemised accounting of his charges. The engineer responded briefly
<blockquote>
	One chalk mark $1<br>
	Knowing where to put it $49,999
</blockquote>
It was paid in full and the engineer retired again in peace.

<hr><b>L</b>ittle Lucy went out into the garden and saw her cat Tiddles lying on the ground with its eyes shut and its legs in the air. She fetched her Dad to look at Tiddles, and on seeing the cat he said, as gently as he could, "I'm afraid Tiddles is dead, Lucy".
<p>"So why are his legs sticking up in the air like that, Daddy?" asked Lucy as she fought back the tears.
<p>At a loss for something to say the father replied, "Tiddles' legs are pointing straight up in the air so that it will be easier for Jesus to float down from heaven above and grab a leg and lift Tiddles up to heaven".
<p>Little Lucy seemed to take her Tiddles death quite well. However, two days later when her father came home from work Lucy had tears in her eyes and said: "Mummy almost died this morning".
<p>Fearing something terrible had happened the father shook the girl and shouted, "How do you mean Lucy? Tell Daddy!
<p>"Well", mumbled Lucy, "soon after you left for work this morning I saw mummy lying on the floor with her legs in the air and she was shouting, "Oh Jesus!!! I'm coming, I'm coming!!!" and if it hadn't been for the milkman holding her down she would definitely have gone, Daddy".

<hr><b>A</b> motorist, after being bogged down in a muddy road, paid a passing farmer fifty dollars to pull him out with his tractor. After he was back on dry ground he said to the farmer, "At those prices, I should think you would be pulling people out of the mud night and day."

<p>Come the night of the concert, all the proud parents fill the hall and watch as Mary, in her prettiest dress, tinkles the ivories to rapturous applause...
<p>Then Timmy steps out in his best suit and recites his poems to the delight of the audience.
<p>Finally, out comes Johnny, in check shirt, and denim overalls. He steps up to the microphone and says...
<p>"Ladies and Gentlemen. My uncle owns a farm and every holiday I visit him there. Tonight, I would like to share with you my impression of some of the many sounds I hear on my uncle's farm.
<p>Here is the first....'Johnny! get off that fucking Tractor!'"

<hr><b>S</b>ilas and Sally were out in the cornfield happily humping away. It had rained that morning and there was lots of mud on the ground and they found themselves sliding around a bit in the mud.

<p>"Well, put it back in you," he replied. After a while, Silas asked again, "Honey, is it in you or in the mud?"
<p>"In me, honey. In me," Sally cooed happily.
<p>"Well, would you mind putting it back in the mud?"

<hr><b>A</b> local preacher was paying a visit to one of his church members on a Friday night, and heard a loud party as he approached the house. He knocked on the door and the owner answered. Behind him, he saw a circle of naked men, with blindfolded women moving from man to man, fondling each man's package, and guessing who it was. The preacher, seeing this, said ...
<p>"I'm sorry. I don't think I'd fit in here right now."
<p>"Nonsense," the man replied. "Your name's been called three times already."

<p>"Tie?" whispers the man. "I need <i>water</i>."
<p>"They're only four dollars apiece."
<p>"I need *water*."
<p>"Okay, okay, say two for seven dollars."
<p>"Please! I need *water*!", says the man.
<p>"I don't have any water, all I have are ties," replies the salesman, and he heads off into the distance.
<p>The man, losing track of time, crawls for what seems like days. Finally, nearly dead, sun-blind and with his skin peeling and blistering, he sees a restaurant in the distance. Summoning the last of his strength he staggers up to the door and confronts the head waiter.
<p>"Water... can I get... water," the dying man manages to stammer. "I'm sorry, sir, ties required."

<hr><b>A</b> man with a bad stomach complaint goes to his doctor and asks him what he can do. The doctor replies that the illness is quite serious but can be cured by inserting a suppository up his anal passage. The man agrees, and so the doctor warns him of the pain, tells him to bend over and shoves the thing way up his behind. The doctor then hands him a second dose and tells him to do the same thing in six hours.
<p>So, the man goes home and later that evening tries to get the second suppository inserted, but he finds that he cannot reach himself properly to obtain the required depth. He calls his wife over and tells her what to do. The wife nods, puts one hand on his shoulder to steady him and with the other shoves the medicine home. Suddenly the man screams, "DAMN!" "What's the matter?" asked the wife, "Did I hurt you?"
<p>"No," replies the man, "but I just realised that when the doctor did that, he had BOTH hands on my shoulder."

<hr><b>T</b>he pope died. As the Pope approached the gates of heaven, it was Saint Peter who greeted him in a firm embrace.
<p>"Is there anything which your holiness desires?"

<p>Saint Peter immediately ushered the Pope to the heavenly library and explained how to retrieve the various documents. The Pope was thrilled and settled down to review the history of man's relationship with God.
<p>Two years later a scream of anguish pierced the stacks of the library. Immediately several of the Saints and Angels came running.

<hr><b>T</b>he carpenter I hired to help me restore an old farmhouse had just finished a rough first day on the job. A flat tyre made him lose an hour of work, his electric saw quit and now his ancient pickup truck refused to start.
<p>While I drove him home, he sat in stony silence. On arriving, he invited me in to meet his family. As we walked toward the front door, he paused briefly at a small tree and touched the tips of the branches with both hands. Opening the door he underwent an amazing transformation. His tanned face was wreathed in smiles and he hugged his two small children and gave
his wife a kiss. Afterward he walked me to the car. We passed the tree and my curiosity got the better of me. I asked him about what I had seen him do earlier.
<p>"Oh, that's my trouble tree", he replied. "I know I can't help having troubles on the job, but one thing for sure, troubles don't belong in the house with my wife and the children. So I just hang them up on the tree every night when I come home. Then in the morning I pick them up again.
Funny thing is," he smiled, "when I come out in the morning to pick em up, there ain't nearly as many as I remember hanging up the night before".

After he finishes he asks her what she is going to tell Mother Superior?
<p>"Well", she said, "I have to tell the truth. I was hurrying back to mass when a man dragged me into his house and raped me twice."
<p>"Twice!", cried the man, "What do you mean. You said you would tell the truth!"
<p>"Well, if you're not too tired!"

<hr><b>T</b>he first morning after the honeymoon, the husband got up early , went down to the kitchen, and brought his wife her breakfast in bed. Naturally, she was delighted. Then her husband spoke:
<p>"Have you noticed just what I have done?"
<p>"Of course, dear; every single detail!"
<p>"Good. Henceforth that's how I want my breakfast served every morning."

<hr><b>T</b>here was an old married couple that had happily lived together for nearly forty years. The only friction in their marriage was caused by the husband's habit of breaking wind nearly every morning as he awoke. The noise would always wake up his wife and the smell would cause her eyes to water as she would choke and gasp for air. Nearly every morning she would plead with him to stop ripping one in the morning. He told her that he couldn't help it.
<p>She begged him to see a doctor to see if anything could be done but the husband wouldn't hear of it. He told her that it was just a natural bodily function and then he would laugh in her face as she tried to wave the fumes away with her hands. She told him that there was nothing natural about it and if he didn't stop, he was one day going to "fart his guts out".
<p>The years went by and the wife continued to suffer and the husband continued to ignore her warnings about "farting his guts out" until one Thanksgiving morning. Before dawn, the wife went downstairs to prepare the family feast. She fixed pumpkin pie, mashed potatoes, gravy and of course a turkey. While she was taking out the turkey's innards, a thought occurred to the wife as to how she might solve her husband's problem. With a devilish grin on her face, she placed the turkey guts into a bowl and quietly walked upstairs hours before her flatulent husband would awake.
<p>While he was still soundly asleep, she pulled back the covers and then gently pulled back her husband's jockey shorts. She then placed all of the turkey guts into her husband's underwear, pulled them up, replaced the covers and tiptoed back downstairs to finish preparing the family meal. Several hours later she heard her husband awake with his normal loud ass-trumpeting. This was soon followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps as her husband ran to the upstairs bathroom.
<p>The wife could not control herself and her eyes began to tear up as she rolled on the floor laughing. After years of putting up with him she had finally gotten even. About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his blood stained underpants with a look of horror in his eyes. She bit her lip to keep from laughing and she asked him what was the matter.
<p>He said, "honey, you were right - all those years you warned me and I didn't listen to you".
<p>"What do you mean?" asked his wife. "Well you always told me that I would end up farting my guts out one of these days and today it finally happened. But by the grace of God and these two fingers, I think I got'em all back in." .........

<hr><b>A</b> man returned home from the night shift and went straight up to the bedroom and found his wife with the sheet pulled over her head, fast asleep. Not to be denied, the horny husband crawled under the sheet and proceeded to make love to her.
<p>Afterward, as he hurried downstairs for something to eat, he was startled to find breakfast on the table and his wife pouring coffee. "How'd you get down her so fast?" he asked. "We were just making love!"
<p>"Oh my God," his wife gasped, "That's my mother up there! She came over early and had complained of having a headache. I told her to lie down for awhile." Rushing upstairs, the wife ran to the bedroom. "Mother, I can't believe this happened. Why didn't you say something?"
<p>The mother-in-law huffed, "I haven't spoken to that jerk for fifteen years and I wasn't about to start now!"

<hr><b>T</b>hree women were having their usual Wednesday lunch together when the conversation took a turn for the

<p>"Wow" replied the second woman. "You know, I found out my husband is having an affair too. I found a condom in his wallet." The first woman exclaimed
<p>"Oh dear! What did you do?" The second woman replied,
<p>"I poked holes in it with a straight pin". The third woman fainted.

<hr><b>T</b>hree cowboys are sitting around a campfire, out on the lonesome prairie, each with the bravado for which cowboys are famous. A night of tall tales begins.
<p>The first says, "I must be the meanest, toughest cowboy there is. Why, just the other day, a bull got loose in the corral and gored six men before I wrestled it to the ground, by the horns, with my bare hands."
<p>The second can't stand to be bested. "Why that's nothing. I was walking down the trail yesterday and a fifteen foot rattler slid out from under a rock and made a move for me. I grabbed that snake with my bare hands, bit its head off, and sucked the poison down in one gulp. And I'm still here today."
<p>The third cowboy remained silent, slowly stirring the coals with his dick.

<hr><b>A</b> little girl runs out to the back-yard where her father is working, and asks him "Daddy, what's sex?"
<p>So, her father sits her down, and tells her all about the birds and the bees. He tells her about conception, sexual intercourse, sperms and eggs etc....He tells her about puberty, menstruation, erections, wet-dreams. He thinks, what the hell, and goes on to tell her the works. He describes masturbation, rape, paedophilia, homosexuality, sex toys, etc., etc. The girl is somewhat awestruck with this sudden influx of bizarre new knowledge, and her father finally asks: "So what did you want to know about sex for ?"
<p>"Oh, mummy said lunch would be ready in a couple of "secs..."

<hr><b>T</b>here was a young man in the Air Force who was so well-endowed that it was bothering his knee. Three Air Force doctors and one Air Force nurse were in the operating room to remedy the situation.
<p>The first doctor said, "We'll just take a big hunk off the end." They discussed it and decided that would affect his sensitivity. The second doctor said, "We'll just take a big hunk out of the middle of it." They discussed this, and decided it would change the texture and feel of it.
<p>The third doctor said, "We'll just take a big hunk off the base of it." They discussed this, too, and agreed that it might give him erection problems. 
<p>The doctors heard a sniffling, and looked over at the nurse who had tears running down her cheeks. The nurse cried, "Can't we just make his legs longer?"

Elvis eventually says to Archangel Gabriel, "Look, we're bored up here, man. Can we be resurrected on Earth for a day, just to break the monotony?" Gabriel, not too sure about it, thinks awhile, and eventually agrees; "But only if you promise not to revert back to any of your former sins... If you do, you're going straight to hell." Elvis, River, and Liberace all agree, and find themselves on Earth. 
<p>As they walk along, Elvis spots a bar and, unable to resist the temptation, heads towards it. As he touches the door handle, *WHOOF* he's gone. River, shocked by this, utters, "Holy shit, man! Gabriel wasn't joking when he said we'd go straight to hell..."
<p>"Never mind, nothing we can do, The King's gone now kid. Let's go" And, they continue walking along the road, when River spots a $5 bag of cocaine lying on the pavement. Just as he bends over to pick it up, *WHOOF*... Liberace disappears.

<hr><b>A</b> woman went to her doctor for a follow-up visit after the doctor had prescribed testosterone (a male hormone) for her. She was a little worried about some of the side effects she was experiencing.
<p>"Doctor, the hormones you've been giving me have really helped, but I'm afraid that you're giving me too much. I've started growing hair in places that I've never grown hair before."
<p>The doctor reassured her. "A little hair growth is a perfectly normal side effect of testosterone. Just where has this hair appeared?"
<p>"On my balls."

<hr><b>O</b>nce upon a time, there were two guys who wanted to pick up women on a beach. One was Italian (Vito) and the other was Russian (Vladamir). Vito had no problem picking up gorgeous women; he was the most popular guy on the beach. But Vladamir had no success.
<p>Vladamir: "Vito! How do you do it? How do you attract so many beautiful women?"
<p>Vito: "Well, I'll tell ya! But it's a secret . . just between you and me. I don't want my system to become too public."
<p>Vladamir: "OK. Its a deal."
<p>Vito: "You see those potatoes over there? Well, every time I come to the beach I take one and put it in my Speedos. When the women see it they come running from miles around."
<p>Vladamir: "That's it? I can do that."
<p>The next day, Vladamir went over to the produce stand and picked out the biggest, most perfectly shaped potato he could find. He then went into the changing room and slipped it into his Speedos.
<p>As he walked out onto the beach he immediately noticed that women AND men began to take notice of him.
<p>"Its working, he thought." But soon he began to realise that they were not looking interested but rather upset, almost disgusted by the sight of him.
<p>He rushed over to Vito and asked "Vito, what's the problem? Why isn't it working?"
<p>Vito: "Because you're supposed to put the potato in the front."

<hr><b>A</b> cargo plane is in mid-flight over the ocean when suddenly the cockpit door burst open to reveal an armed,
masked hijacker to a startled pilot, copilot, navigator, and stewardess. 
<p>He held a gun to the pilot's head and said, "Take this plane to Iraq or I'm gonna spill your brains all over the place. The pilot calmly reached up, pushed the gun aside and says, "Look buddy, if you shoot me this plane will crash right into the sea and you'll die along with the rest of us."
<p>The hijacker thought about it, then held the gun to the copilot's head and said, "Take this plane to Iraq or I'm gonna spill HIS brains all over the place." But the copilot also calmly reached up, pushed the gun aside and said, "Listen to me. The pilot's got a bad heart and he could keel over at the shock of my being killed. So if you shoot me, this plane will
still crash right into the sea and you'll die along with the rest of us."
<p>The hijacker thought about it for a moment and then held the gun to the navigator's head and repeated, "Take this plane to Iraq or I'm gonna spill HIS brains all over the place." But the navigator calmly reached up, pushed the gun aside and said, "I wouldn't do that if I were you. Those other two guys have no sense of direction. Without me they couldn't find
their way out of a paper bag much less get this plane to Iraq. So if you shoot me, this plane will still crash right into the sea and you'll die along with the rest of us."
<p>The hijacker thought some more, shrugged and this time held the gun to the stewardess's head and demanded, "Take this plane to Iraq or I'm gonna spill HER brains all over the place." No one says a word, but the stewardess leaned over and whispered something into the hijacker's ear. He turned beet red, dropped his gun, and ran out of the cockpit in a panic.
<p>The crew tracked down the hijacker, who was found cowering behind some crates in the hold, and tied him up. The pilot then asked the stewardess what she said that terrified the man so. "I told him, sir," she replied, "that if he killed me, He'd be the one who'd have to give you guys your blowjobs."

<p>"Aren't you going to kiss me..??" asks the frog, "I'll turn into a ravishing woman and you can have anything you want!!"

<p>She looked at him, puzzled, and said, "T-G-I-F" again.
<p>He acknowledged her remark again by answering, "S-H-I-T."

<hr><b>T</b>he local bar was so sure that its bartender had the strongest hands around that they offered a standing $1000 bet. The bartender would squeeze a lemon until all the juice ran into a glass, and hand the lemon to a challenger. Anyone who could squeeze one more drop of juice out would win the money.
<p>Many people had tried over time (weight-lifters, longshoremen, etc.) but nobody could do it. One day this scrawny little man came into the bar, wearing thick glasses and a polyester suit, and said in a tiny squeaky voice, "I'd like to try the bet."
<p>After the laughter had died down, the bartender said OK, grabbed a lemon, and squeezed away. Then he handed the wrinkled remains of the rind to the little man. But the crowd's laughter turned to total silence as the man clenched his fist around the lemon and six drops fell into the glass.
<p>As the crowd cheered, the bartender paid the $1000, and asked the little man, "What do you do for a living? Are you a lumberjack, a weight-lifter, or what?"
<p>The man replied, "I work for the IRS."

<hr><b>T</b>here's a little fellow named Junior who hangs out at Tim Alley's Grocery Store. Manager Tim doesn't know what Junior's problem is, but the boys like to tease him. They say he is two bricks shy of a load, or two pickles shy of a barrel.
<p>To prove it, sometimes they offer Junior his choice between a nickel and a dime. He always takes the nickel, they say, because it's bigger.
<p>One day after Junior grabbed the nickel, Manager Tim got him off to one side and said, "Junior, those boys are making fun of you. They think you don't know the dime is worth more than the nickel. Are you grabbing the nickel because it's bigger, or what?" Junior said, "Well, if I took the dime, they'd quit doing it!"

barbender, I would like a Martoutsy." The bartender brought her a Martini, which she drinks in one gulp.
<p>"Barbender, I would like another Martoutsy", again the bartender brought her a Martini. By this time the lady is leaning heavily forward, barely able to hang on. She called, "Barbender, your Martoutsys are giving me heartburn."
<p>Patiently, the bartender came near her and said, "Lady, I am not a barbender, but a bartender, and what you have been drinking is not a Martoutsy, but a Martini, and finally, you do not have heartburn, your tit is hanging in the ashtray."

<p>The drunk was not without a plan, however. He approached Rooney and offered him a deal. "I've been noticing these flies for the last week. "If you'll give me a shot, I'll kill every one of them for you". Rooney gave him the agreed-upon shot. Once he had downed it, O'Malley got up and headed for the door. "All right," he shouted, "send them out----one at a time"!

<p>"One day," he begins, "I was hunting when I got lost in the woods. I heard someone crying for help and finally realised that it was coming from a frog sitting next to a stream. So I picked up the frog and it said, "Kiss me. Kiss me and I will turn into a genie and grant you 3 wishes."
<p>So I looked around to make sure I was alone and gave the frog a kiss. POOF! The frog turned into a beautiful, voluptuous, naked woman. She said, "You now have 3 wishes." I looked down at my scrawny 115 pound body and said, "I want a body like Arnold Schwarzenneger." She nodded, whispered a spell, and POOF! there I was, so huge that I ripped out of my clothes and was standing there naked! She then asked, "What will be your second wish?"
<p>I looked hungrily at her beautiful body and replied, "I want to make sensuous love with you here by this stream." She nodded, laid down, and beckoned to me. We then made love for hours! Later, as we lay there next to each other, sweating from our glorious lovemaking, she whispered into my ear, "You know, you do have one more wish. What will it be?" I looked at her and replied, "How about a little head?"

<p>"Well," said Linda, "since you're being honest, so will I. See, I'm a hooker."
<p>"Oh, I see," he said pensively. 
<p>Then, he smiled and said.... "It's probably because you're not keeping your wrists straight when you hit the ball."

<hr><b>A</b> small bottle containing urine sat upon the desk of Sir William Osler, the eminent professor of medicine at Oxford University. Sitting before him was a class full of young, wide-eyed medical students, listening to his lecture on the importance of observing details. To emphasise his point, he announced: "This bottle contains a sample for analysis. It's often possible by tasting it to determine the disease from which the patient suffers."
<p>He then dipped a finger into the fluid and brought it into his mouth. He continued speaking: "Now I am going to pass the bottle around. Each of you please do exactly as I did. Perhaps we can learn the importance of this technique and diagnose the case."
<p>The bottle made its way from row to row, each student gingerly poking his finger in and bravely sampling the contents with a frown. Dr Osler then retrieved the bottle and startled his students by saying, "Gentlemen, now you will understand what I mean when I speak about details. Had you been observant, you would have seen that I put my index finger in the bottle but my middle finger into my mouth!"

<p>No one answered.
<p>"ALRIGHT, I'M GONNA HAVE ANOTHER BEER, AND IF MY HOSS AIN'T BACK OUTSIDE BY THE TIME I FINISH, I'M GONNA DO WHAT I DONE IN TEXAS! AND I DON'T LIKE TO HAVE TO DO WHAT I DONE IN TEXAS!"
<p>Some of the locals shifted restlessly. He had another beer, walked outside, and his horse is back! He saddles-up and starts to ride out of town. The bartender wanders out of the bar and asks, "Say partner, before you go... what happened in Texas?"
<p>The cowboy turned back and said, "I had to walk home."

<p>On it were printed the words "Fishing off Florida".
<p>Clever Dick laughed. "Actually", he said, "my father is dead"! It had been a tricky question!!
<p>The salesman, carefully chosen for his ability to think fast on his feet, immediately replied that he was sorry the answer was unsatisfactory, but as computers were precise, perhaps he might care to rephrase his question and try again?
<p>Clever Dick thought, went to the Ultimate Computer and this time said, "Where is my mother's husband"?
<p>Again there was a whirring of wheels and a flashing of lights.
<p>And again a little card popped out. Printed on it were the words: "Dead. But your father is still fishing off Florida."

<hr><b>A</b> famous reporter was doing a documentary on the customs of the American Indians. After a tour of a reservation that they were on, she asked what was the significance and major differences in the number of feathers on the head dresses that they were wearing.
<p>She asked a young Indian who only had one feather on his head dress. His reply was, "ME ONLY HAVE ONE WIFE, ME HAVE ONLY ONE FEATHER."
<p>She asked another young man, feeling that the first guy was only joking. This young Indian had four feathers on his head dress. He replied, "OGH! ME HAVE FOUR FEATHERS BECAUSE ME SLEEPS WITH FOUR WIVES."
<p>Still not convinced about the number of feathers actually indicated the number of wives involved, she decided to interview the Chief. Now the Chief had a head dress full of feathers, which needless to say, amused the reporter.
<p>She asked the Chief, "Why do you have so many feathers on your head dress?"
<p>The chief proudly pounded his chest and said, "ME CHIEF! ME FUCK-EM ALL, BIG, SMALL, FAT, TALL, ME FUCK-EM ALL!!"
<p>Horrified, the reporter stated, "YOU OUGHT TO BE HUNG!!"
<p>The chief replied, "YOU DAMNED RIGHT ME HUNK.....BIG LIKE BUFFALO, LONG LIKE SNAKE!!"
<p>The reporter cried, "YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SO HOSTILE."
<p>The chief replied, "HORSE-STYLE, DOG STYLE, WOLF-STYLE, ANY STYLE, ME FUCK EM ALL!"
<p>Tears in her eyes, the reporter cried, "OH DEAR!!"
<p>The chief replied, "NO DEER, ME NO FUCK DEER, ASSHOLE TOO HIGH AND FUCKERS RUN TOO FAST, ME NO FUCK DEER!"

<hr><b>A</b> woman goes into Wal-Mart to buy a rod and reel. She doesn't know which one to get so she just grabs one and goes over to the register. There is a Wal-Mart "associate" standing there with dark shades on. She says, "Excuse me sir...can you tell me anything about this rod and reel?"
<p>He says, "Ma'am I'm blind but if you will drop it on the counter I can tell you everything you need to know about it from the sound that it makes." She didn't believe him, but dropped it on the counter anyway. He said, "That's a 6' graphite rod with a Zebco 202 reel and 10 lb. test line...It's a good all around rod and reel and it's $20.00".
<p>She says, "That's amazing that you can tell all that just by the sound of it dropping on the counter. I think it's what I'm looking for so I'll take it."
<p>He walks behind the counter to the register, and in the meantime the woman farts. At first she is embarrassed but then realises that there is no way he could tell it was her, being blind he wouldn't know that she was the only person around. He rings up the sale and says, "That will be $25.50."
<p>She says, "But didn't you say it was $20.00?"
<p>He says, "Yes ma'am, the rod and reel is $20.00, the duck call is $3.00, and the catfish stink bait is $2.50."

<hr><b>T</b>his guy walks into a quiet bar. He is carrying three ducks. One in each hand and one under his left arm. He places them on the bar. He has a few drinks and chats with the Bartender. The Bartender is experienced and has learned not to ask people about the animals that they bring into the bar, so he doesn't mention the ducks. They chat for about 30 minutes before the guy with the ducks has to go to the restroom. The ducks are left on the bar. The bartender is alone with the ducks. There is an awkward silence.
<p>The Bartender decides to try to make some conversation. "What's your name?" he says to the first duck. "Huey" said the first duck.
<p>"How's your day been, Huey?"
<p>"Great. Lovely day. Had a ball. Been in and out of puddles all day".
<p>"Oh. That's nice.", says the Bartender.
<p>Then he says to the second duck "Hi. And what's your name?".
<p>"Dewey" came the answer. "So how's your day been, Dewey?".
<p>"Great. Lovely day. Had a ball. Been in and out of puddles all day. If I had the chance another day I would do the same again".
<p>So the Bartender turns to the third duck and says "So, you must be Louie". "No", growls the third duck, "My name is Puddles."

<p>About 30 minutes into the trip a stewardess, noticed the man shaking and quivering. "Are you OK, sir?" asked the stewardess?
<p>"Ahh... Yes, I'm fine," said the man.
<p>Sometime later the stewardess noticed the man moaning, and shaking again..
<p>"Are you sure you're all right sir?"
<p>"Yes," said the man, "but I have a confession to make. I didn't have time to get the paperwork to bring a puppy on board, so I hid him down the front of my pants."
<p>"What's wrong?" asked the stew, "Is he not house broken?"
<p>"No, that's not the problem.... The problem is he's not weaned yet!"

<p>As soon as he got his head between her legs, she let out a rip-roaring fart.
<p>"What the hell was that?!?" he asked.
<p>"Oops! I'm so sorry! Let's try again" she said.

<hr><b>T</b>he receptionist at Shockoe Clinic, Hilda Honaker, came into the lobby the other morning shaking her head in concern. I asked what was the matter, and she said her car was giving her trouble.
<p>"It's always run beautifully, but all of a sudden it's burning so much oil! And it gives off smelly bluish smoke. I'm ashamed to be seen driving such a polluter! Doctor, do you know anything about automobiles?"
<p>"Well," I said, "I'm no mechanic, but if you'll tell me what make of car you drive I'll try to make a semi-educated guess."
<p>Hilda said: "Why, I drive a Saturn."
<p>I smiled, held up a finger, and declared: "Ah, then it's obvious ... you just need new rings!"

<hr><b>T</b>he other day I went into the local religious book store, where I saw a "Honk if you love Jesus" bumper sticker. I bought it and put it on the back bumper of my car, and I'm really glad I did.
<p>What an uplifting experience followed! 
<p>I was stopped at a light in a busy intersection, just lost in thoughts of the Lord, and I didn't notice that the light had changed. That bumper sticker really worked! I found lots of people who love Jesus.
<p>Why the guy behind me started to honk like crazy. He must really love the Lord because pretty soon, he leaned out his window and yelled "Jesus Christ!" as loud as he could. It was like a football game with him shouting, "Go Jesus Christ! Go!"
<p>Everyone else started honking, too, so I leaned out my window and waved and smiled to all of those loving people. There must of been a guy from Florida back there because I could here him yelling something about a "sunny beach", and I saw him waving in a funny way with his middle finger stuck up in the air. I asked my two kids what that meant. They squirmed, looked
at each other, giggled and told me that it was the Hawaiian good luck sign so I leaned out the window and gave him the good luck sign back.
<p>Several cars behind, a very nice large man stepped out of his car and yelled something. I couldn't hear him very well, but it sounded like, "Mother trucker," or mothers from there. Maybe he was from Florida too. He must really love the Lord.
<p>A couple of the people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and were walking toward me. I bet they wanted to pray, but just then I noticed the light had changed to yellow, and I stepped on the gas. And a good thing I did, because I was the only driver to get across the intersection. I looked back at them standing there. I leaned way out the window, gave them a big smile and held up the Hawaiian good luck sign as I drove away.
<p>Praise the Lord for such wonderful people.

<hr><b>D</b>avid received a parrot for his birthday. This parrot was fully grown, with a bad attitude and worse vocabulary. Every other word was an expletive. 
<p>Those that weren't expletives were, to say the least, rude.
<p>David tried hard to change the bird's attitude and was constantly speaking politely, demonstrating good manners, playing soft music, anything he could think of to set a good example. Nothing worked. He yelled at the bird and the bird got worse. He shook the bird and the bird got angrier and ruder.
<p>Finally, in a moment of desperation, David put the parrot in the freezer. 
<p>For a few moments he heard the bird squawking, kicking and screaming. Then suddenly, there was quiet.
<p>Frightened that he might have hurt the bird, David quickly opened the freezer door. The parrot calmly stepped out onto David's extended arm and said,
<p>"I deeply regret that I might have offended you with my language and behaviour and I humbly beg your forgiveness. I will endeavor to correct my behaviour and bad language."
<p>He was astonished at the bird's change in attitude and was about to ask what had made such a dramatic turnaround, when the parrot continued quietly,
<p>"May I ask . . . what the chicken did?"

<hr><b>A</b>ustralian bricklayer report. Possibly the funniest story in a long while. This is a bricklayer's accident report, which was published in the newsletter of the Australian equivalent of the Workers Compensation board. This is a true story. Had this guy died, he'd have received a Darwin Award for sure.......
<p>Dear Sir,
<br>I am writing in response to your request for additional information in Block 3 of the accident report form. I put poor planning as the cause of my accident. You asked for a fuller explanation and I trust the following details will be sufficient.
<p>I am a bricklayer by trade. On the day of the accident, I was working alone on the roof of a new six-floor building. When I completed my work, I found that I had some bricks left over which, when weighed later were found to be slightly in excess of 250kg. Rather than carry the bricks down by hand, I decided to lower them in a barrel by using a pulley, which was attached to the side of the building on the sixth floor. Securing the rope at ground I went up to the roof, swung the barrel out and loaded the bricks into it. Then I went down and untied the rope, holding it tightly to ensure a slow descent of the bricks. You will note in Block 11 of the accident report form that I weigh 75kg. Due to my surprise at being jerked off the ground so suddenly, I lost my presence of mind and forgot to let go of the rope. Needless to say, I proceeded at a rapid rate up the side of the building. In the vicinity of the third floor I met the barrel, which was now proceeding downward at an equally impressive speed. This explaines the fractured skull, minor abrasions and the broken collar bone, as listed in Block 3 of the accident report form.
<p>Slowed only slightly, I continued my rapid ascent, not stopping until the fingers of my right hand were two knuckles deep into the pulley. Fortunately by this time I had regained my presence of mind and was able to hold tightly to the rope, in spite of beginning to experince pain. At approximately the same time, however, the barrel of bricks hit the ground and the bottom fell out of the barrel. Now devoid of the weight of the bricks, that barrel weighed approximately 25kg.
<p>I refer you again to my weight. As you can imagine, I began a rapid descent, down the side of the building. In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel coming up. This accounts for the two fractured ankles, broken tooth and several lacerations of my legs and lower body.
<p>Here my luck began to change slightly. The encounter with the barrel seemed to slow me enough to lessen my injuries when I fell into the pile of bricks and fortunately only three vertebrae were cracked. I am sorry to report, however, as I lay there on the pile of bricks, in pain and unable to move, I again lost my composure and presence of mind and let go of the rope and I lay there watching the empty barrel begin its journey back down onto me. This explains two broken legs.
<p>I hope this answers your enquiry.
<p>Kind Regards,
<p>Mike P....
