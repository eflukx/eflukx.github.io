<p>This site was initially created some time in late 1998, and has progressed from a single page (a somewhat shorter version of the bi-amping article) to what you see today. I have gradually built up the content, and the overall site "map" has changed several times as I have tried to incorporate all the new stuff in a reasonably sensible manner.

<p>As the site continues to grow, you will see more changes, but I will always keep the user interface as simple as possible to maximise loading speed. This is one reason that you won't see fancy mapped graphics, frames, flash animations or other frills that might make the site look really cool, but at the expense of download times.

<p>The overall philosophy of the site has never changed - keep to the facts, stay away from the constant efforts of the subjectivist camp to ever "improve" on what they have (almost always with expensive "tweaks" whose performance cannot be measured, only heard by people with "finely tuned ears" <img src="grin.gif" alt=":-)"> ). Music is to listen to. Recordings are rarely perfect, the concept of reproduction ever matching a live performance is a myth. Listen to the music, not the equipment.

<p>This is not to say that good equipment is not something to strive for, since the enjoyment is greater when it sounds good. I love to experiment, and many of the designs are experimental - in some cases just to prove a point (the DoZ is a perfect example). Sometimes these experiments backfire (the DoZ is a perfect example!), and I get a whole bunch of e-mail telling me how great it sounds.

<p>How much of the great sound is purely the result of the reader having built it himself/herself? I honestly have no idea, but it doesn't matter. If people can get double the enjoyment from building and then listening to equipment then so much the better. In the long run it is all about enjoyment; of music, of making something and of life.

<p>May you all enjoy building my projects as much as I enjoy bringing them to you.</p>

<hr /><b>Images</b>
<p>I have been asked many times about the way I create the circuit diagrams (or schematics, if you insist), and over the time the pages have been running this has changed. I currently use either Protel or SIMetrix to draw the diagrams (although I have used other methods in some of the earlier drawings). These are simply captured and pasted into Paintbrush for some minor touch-ups, and the final image is then exported as a GIF file. This method is a little time consuming, but I have found that the images are very clear, and I get consistent results.</p>

<hr /><b>Articles &amp; Projects</b>
<p>The content of all the articles and projects is entirely my own unless otherwise stated. This extends to the philosophy of the site itself, which is mine and mine alone. This (of course) does not mean that others will not have similar ideas (many do), nor that I automatically disagree with the opinions of others who might have a slightly different opinion on the same subject. I have been corrected many, many times - for anything from spelling mistakes to errors in diagrams (I have even managed to get a few electrolytics backwards - oops!), and various people have assisted with additional information on a number of occasions.

<p>I do not (knowingly) steal the ideas, drawings or other content of others, and any information from others is reproduced with permission and full credit is given to the original author. Contributions are encouraged, as I am determined to make the best audio web site around, and I cannot do it alone.

<p><small>There is a very small number of images on these pages that seem to be in the public domain, and I have used some of these where appropriate. If any reader out there sees their image on my pages and is offended that I purloined it, let me know and I will remove it.</small></p>

<p>Sometimes you see an image that is just too wonderful to ignore - the picture * here falls into that category. It was sent to me by a friend, and I am sorry to say that I know not where it came from. I just loved it on sight!
<p>I do not use (or condone the use of) spam (the web kind or the canned variety), so you will never get bulk e-mail or cans of "meat-like substance" from me for any reason, so that image is appropriate in its own silly way :-)</p>
<p>I just wish I knew where it came from so I could thank its creator. Whoever you are - my thanks and apologies for "borrowing" this image.</p>
<br /><br />
<p>Cheers,<br />
