<hr>It is so often beneficial to have something to laugh at (other than management and the antics of our elected representatives), that I have this humour collection - expect it to grow. Contributions from readers are most welcome.

<p>Please Note:&nbsp; I don't want to offend anyone, and the Joke Collections have many risque offerings that may cause offence - please, if you don't like "off colour" jokes, don't go there.</p>
