To err is human, but to really foul things up requires a computer.
<blockquote>
<ol>
	<li>Any given program, when running, is obsolete.
	<li>Any given program costs more and takes longer.
	<li>If a program is useful, it will have to be changed.
	<li>If a program is useless, it will have to be documented.
	<li>Any program will expand to fill available memory. (aka Microsoft's Law)
	<li>The value of a program is proportional to the weight of its output.
	<li>Program complexity grows until it exceeds the capabilities of the programmer who must maintain it.
	<li>Any non-trivial program contains at least one bug.
	<li>A non-trivial program is defined as any program with more than one line of code 
	<li>Undetectable errors are infinite in variety, in contrast to detectable errors, which by definition are limited.
	<li>Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.

<p><b>From H. L. Mencken ...</b></p>
<p>An idealist is one who, on noticing that roses smell better than a cabbage, concludes that it will also make better soup.
<p>Whenever you hear a man speak of his love for his country, it is a sure sign he expects to be paid for it.
<p>Democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard.
<p>A judge is a law student who marks his own examination papers.
<p>Adultery is the application of democracy to love.
<p>Sin is a dangerous toy in the hands of the virtuous.&nbsp; It should be left to the congenitally sinful who know when to play with it and when to leave it alone.
<p>In human history, a moral victory is always a disaster for it debauches and degrades both the victor and the vanquished.
<p>There is only one sound argument for democracy, and that is the argument that it is a crime for any man to hold himself out as better than other men, and, above all, a most heinous crime for him to prove it.</p>

<p>1.&nbsp; Never share a foxhole with anyone braver than you are.
<p>2.&nbsp; No battle plan ever survives contact with the enemy. &nbsp; - &nbsp;<font class="t-sml">Field Marshall Helmuth Carl Bernard von Moltke</font>
<p>3.&nbsp; Friendly fire isn't.
<p>4.&nbsp; The most dangerous thing in the combat zone is an officer with a map.
<p>5.&nbsp; The problem with taking the easy way out is that the enemy has already mined it.
<p>6.&nbsp; The buddy system is essential to your survival; it gives the enemy somebody else to shoot at.
<p>7.&nbsp; The further you are in advance of your own positions, the more likely your artillery will shoot short.
<p>8.&nbsp; Incoming fire has the right of way.
<p>9.&nbsp; If your advance is going well, you are walking into an ambush.
<p>10. The quartermaster has only two sizes, too large and too small.
<p>11. If you really need an officer in a hurry, take a nap.
<p>12. The only time suppressive fire works is when it is used on abandoned positions.
<p>13. The only thing more accurate than incoming enemy fire is incoming friendly fire.
<p>14. There is nothing more satisfying than having someone take a shot at you, and miss.
<p>14a. &nbsp;  There is nothing more exhilarating than to be shot at without result.&nbsp; - &nbsp;<font class="t-sml">Winston Churchill</font>
<p>15. Don't be conspicuous. In the combat zone, it draws fire. Out of the combat zone, it draws sergeants.
<p>16. If your sergeant can see you, so can the enemy.
<p>17. Never worry about the bullet with your name on it. Instead, worry about shrapnel addressed to 'occupant'.
<p>18. All battles are fought at the junction of two or more map sheets.
<blockquote>
	18.1 ...printed at different scales;<br />
	18.2 ...uphill;<br />
	18.3 ...and in the rain.
</blockquote>
<p>19. Logistics is the ball and chain of armoured warfare.&nbsp; - &nbsp;<font class="t-sml">Heinz Guderian</font>
<p>20. The army with the smartest dress uniform will lose.
<p>21. What gets you promoted from one rank gets you killed in the next rank.
<p>22. A good plan today is better than a perfect plan tomorrow.&nbsp; - &nbsp;<font class="t-sml">George Patton</font>
<p>23. If orders can be misunderstood, they have been.
<p>24. Tracer works both ways.
<p>25. If the enemy is in range, so are you.
<p>26. War is like love. To triumph, you must make contact.&nbsp; - &nbsp;<font class="t-sml">Attributed to Napoleon</font>
<p>27. Boldness becomes rarer, the higher the rank.&nbsp; - &nbsp;<font class="t-sml">Karl von Clausewitz</font>
<p>28. Never reinforce failure. Failure reinforces itself.
<p>29. Only 5% of an intelligence report is accurate. The trick of a good commander is to isolate the 5%.&nbsp; - &nbsp;<font class="t-sml">Douglas MacArthur</font>
<p>30. Tactics is for amateurs; professionals study logistics.
<p>31. When a front line soldier overhears two General Staff officers conferring, he's fallen back too far.
<p>32. It isn't necessary to be an idiot to be a senior officer, but it sure helps.
<p>33. No captain can do very wrong who places his ship alongside that of the enemy.&nbsp; - &nbsp;<font class="t-sml">Vice Admiral Lord Horatio Nelson</font>
<p>34: Only numbers can annihilate.&nbsp; - &nbsp;<font class="t-sml">Vice Admiral Lord Horatio Nelson</font>
<p>35a. Always know when it's time to get out of Dodge.
<p>35b. Always know <i>how</i> to get out of Dodge.
<p>36. Your equipment was made by the lowest bidder.
<p>37. Priorities are made by officers, not God. There's a difference.
<p>38. Always honour a threat.
<p>39. The weight of all of your equipment is proportional to the cube of the time you have been carrying it.
<p>40. Hell hath no fury like a non-combatant.&nbsp; - &nbsp;<font class="t-sml">Charles Edward Montague</font>
41. Fighter pilots make movies; attack pilots make history.
<p>42. There are two kinds of naval vessels: submarines and targets.
