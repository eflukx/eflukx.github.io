<hr><a id="intro"></a><b>Introduction</b>
<p>The so-called "Trimode" system used by most car amps seems mysterious, as there is no speaker switching, and commonly only a simple stereo/ Mono switch.&nbsp; Even without the switch being operated, a speaker connected between the +ve (Red) terminal of one amp (typically the left channel) and the -ve (black) terminal of the other will still work with a typical stereo signal.</p>
<p>There is nothing magical about this, and the basic concept is used in almost every car amp known.&nbsp; What follows is a simplification, but describes the process and how it works.</p>

<hr><b><a id="descr"></a>Decription</b>
<p>A schematic of a trimode amp is shown below, in Figure 1.&nbsp; As you can see, there are two completely normal power amplifiers, and a simple inverter circuit is used in front of the Right channel amp.&nbsp; The "trick" is that the output terminals for this inverted channel are reversed, so the +ve Red terminal is actually connected to ground (chassis), and the -ve Black terminal connects to the amp's output.&nbsp; For any normal stereo signal, this maintains the correct polarity of the system, and the speakers will not be out of phase.</p>

<center><img src="brdg-f1.gif" alt="Figure 1" border=1><br><small><b>Figure 1 - Trimode Amplifier Schematic</b></small></center>

<p>The opamp is usually nothing special, and virtually any standard opamp (such as a TL071) can be used.&nbsp; If another opamp is used in the front end, then the device may be a dual opamp - I have deliberately not added pin numbers, since you will need to work out for yourself what you need here.</p>

<p>Since this is not intended as a design as such, if you want to use this method, you will have to work out the details for yourself.&nbsp; Do <b>not</b> send me e-mails asking for a complete design!&nbsp; There is enough detail here for anyone who is capable of wiring a simple circuit, and who understands the basics of amplifiers in general terms.&nbsp; The +/-12V for the opamp is commonly taken from the main switching supply, either using a separate small winding, or by using regulators off the main supply.</p>

<p>Again, you will have to work this out for yourself - I will not do it for you.</p>

<p><a id="how"></a><b>How Does it Work?</b><br>
A bridge tied load (BTL) amplifier applies a normal signal to one terminal of the speaker, and an inverted signal to the other.&nbsp; If a single amp is capable of producing 20V RMS across the speaker, this equates to 
P&nbsp;=&nbsp;V<sup><small>2</small></sup>&nbsp;/&nbsp;R, so in this case, 20^2&nbsp;/&nbsp;4&nbsp;=&nbsp;100W.</p>

<p>When connected in BTL, the same speaker "sees" 20V at one terminal, and an inverted 20V signal on the other - a total of 40V RMS (I shall leave the proof of this to the reader :-)&nbsp; Using the same formula, 40^2&nbsp;/&nbsp;4&nbsp;=&nbsp;400W - <b>four</b> times the power.&nbsp; But ... each amp now sees only half the load impedance (think of an imaginary centre tap in the voice coil, connected to ground).&nbsp; The amplifier must be stable into 2 ohms, or this method will not work.&nbsp; Of course, you can use an 8 ohm speaker and still get 200W if the amplifier cannot drive 2 ohms safely.

<hr><b><a id="outro"></a>Conclusion</b>
<p>The method described here is in almost universal use for car amplifiers, is simple and works well.&nbsp; Strangely enough, it is rarely used in (home) hi-fi amplifiers, possibly because it would be considered "unacceptable" by audiophiles (for whatever reason).</p>
<p>As stated above, please don't e-mail me for further information on the construction of high power car amps.&nbsp; There is a project article for a high powered switchmode converter, and that can be used with almost all amplifiers shown on these pages - however, none of the amps I have presented will drive 2 ohms safely, and they are not recommended for car audio use.&nbsp; Most car amps are very rugged, but are typically of "sub-hifi" performance, often having relatively high levels of crossover distortion (especially audible at low impedance and low volumes).</p>

<p>A power amplifier for car audio use may be offered at some later time, but at the present there is nothing available on these pages that I consider suitable.&nbsp; Several people have enquired about using LM3886 power op-amps, and although these will work, they really need to be connected in parallel.&nbsp; There is an excellent Application Note (AN-1192) on how best to do this available on the <a href="http://www.national.com/an/AN/AN-1192.pdf">National Semiconductor</a> site (the document is a PDF file - approx 529k in size).&nbsp; There is also a simplified method of achieving the same result as shown above, but bear in mind that input impedance will be low (and there are possible stability concerns as well).</p>
