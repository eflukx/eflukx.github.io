<p>Well, could this be genuine? NO! Reputable companies never spam people, and if you really have been sought out, they will use your name. The header of e-mails is often a dead giveaway, as is spelling and punctuation, use of capital letters and general structure.</p>
<p>Note that the return e-mail address is "swis-invest-ltd.com" - there is an 's' missing from 'swiss'. In this case, the header shows that the e-mail has been bounced around - one of the suspicious domains being 'noscash.com'. If you look it up, it appears to be a porn site hosting service or a porn referral service of some kind.</p>
<p>Would a reputable company use a very dodgy porn oriented site to send their e-mails? Seems somewhat unlikely (to put it mildly).</p>

<hr><b><a id="s11"></a>1.1 - How the Swiss Invest Scam Works</b>
<p>Firstly, this scam appears to use the name of a real company, in the hope that you will be tricked into believing that it is genuine. It isn't!</p>
<p>Like many such scams, you become a part of a fraud or a money laundering scheme. Money (possibly illegally removed from other accounts after a successful phishing expedition) is sent to your bank account (so <i>you</i> can be traced), and you pass it on using absolutely untraceable Western Union or 'money gram' services. When (not if, <i>when</i>) the police come knocking on your door because of suspicious activities (for example, the scammers might be pretending to sell something, but never deliver, or the illegal bank transfers are traced to your account), do you honestly think that the courts are going to believe that you had nothing to do with it?</p>
<p>This type of scam still catches lots of people. Relatively innocent (but naive or stupid) people have been prosecuted for being part of frauds just like this one. </p>

<hr><b><a id="s20"></a>2.0 - National Australia Bank</b>
<p>This is a classic phishing e-mail. Nothing about it is genuine, the grammar is certainly not what one would expect from a major bank, and the underlying text shows absolutely that it is a fraud. Also, in Australia, 'apologi<b>z</b>e' is spelled 'apologi<b>s</b>e'. This is not a mistake I'd expect any genuine Australian company (or bank) to make.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="scamnab.gif" alt="NAB Scam" border="1"></p>

<p>The underlying text was not visible in the e-mail, but displaying the message source (which also shows the <a href="scam2.txt" onclick="NewWindow(this.href,'','600','450');return false" onfocus="this.blur()">header</a> info) reveals what is underneath ...

</pre></blockquote>

<p>The above is meaningless drivel, probably assembled by a computer program to make it appear to spam filters that there is a genuine message. Note that the image filename is 'besmirch.gif" - an interesting choice of words (besmirch means to stain or sully, or to make dirty, soil).</p>
<p>Again, the header is a dead giveaway that the message is a fraud (even if you didn't pick it as a phishing scam straight off). Although this scam is well below the standard that one would expect from a bank (it is extremely crude), it is possible (probable?) that a couple of people in Australia would have been caught.</p>
<p>In the site's source code, the date uses US format (mm/dd/yyyy) and is 10/23/2004 - this format is <i>never</i> used in Australia.</p>

<hr><b><a id="s21"></a>2.1 - How the NAB Scam Works</b>
<p>This is an easy one. The URL indicated on the visible message is completely different from that in the e-mail source. When you click on the image, you are directed to a website that looks (a bit) like the National Australia Bank's site, but asks you to provide your Enter your National ID, Internet Banking Password, your full name and e-mail address. Other similar scams ask for your PIN (Personal Identification Number) and many other things that <i>no</i> bank will ever ask. Such pages are almost never encrypted (watch for the little yellow padlock in the bottom right corner of your web browser), and having looked at the page source for several such sites, the information is sent to a web address - it may be in Russia, China, The Philippines or any number of locations.</p>
<p>In this case, the site URL is registered in China (the URL looks like it's in Australia, but if you read <i>all</i> of it, you see it ends with 'cn' (China).</p>

<blockquote>http://www.national.com.au.r0f4p0dr.dllinfo.<b>cn</b>/r1/n/</blockquote>

<p>With any URL, the domain name is <i>everything</i> between the 'http://' and the next '/' character. This URL has been made to look like the real thing, but is obviously false. The site itself goes to great pains to make sure that you can't see the source code, and makes heavy use of Javascript, popups (which reload as soon as you close them - major alert!!), and after you enter your details (I entered complete rubbish) redirects you back to the real NAB website. To the uninitiated, it might even look real. One thing they did that gives away the fact that it's a scam (to reasonably experienced Internet users) was to prevent you from viewing other open browser windows, the popup that refuses to close until you give it some information, and disabling editing of the URL (location) field - the traps used are never applied by any legitimate website.</p>
<p>Once the 'phishermen' have your details, they may withdraw funds from your account, and send the money thus obtained to another bank account in the same country. The Swiss Invest and Ecolife scams will hopefully have provided a few suckers who will accept the fraudulent transfers and forward the scammer's ill gotten gains using an untraceable service such as the criminal organisation Western Union.</p>
<p>For those who may be interested, the <a href="scamnab.txt" onclick="NewWindow(this.href,'','600','450');return false" onfocus="this.blur()">Website</a> source code can be viewed. Yes, it's in a popup window, but at least you can close it <img src="grin.gif">.

<hr><b><a id="s30"></a>3.0 - EcoLife</b>
<p>As always, make sure you view the message source of any suspect e-mail. The header information reveals a great deal - you don't need to understand all of it, just look for anything that is suspicious. The <a href="scam3.txt" onclick="NewWindow(this.href,'','600','450');return false" onfocus="this.blur()">header</a> for this scam shows where the message originated (commonly and almost certainly falsified), and the message path. Again, a porn site is a part of the message path (dam-teens.com), and again, no reputable business would use this method for mail delivery.</p>

<p>Note that this one may appeal to people who are concerned about the environment, so it has used a two-pronged approach to sucking you in. The promise of 'easy' money, <i>plus</i>, you will be helping our endangered environment. It's endangered alright, but these bastards won't be cleaning it up - they're too busy trying to clean you out!</p>

<hr><b><a id="s31"></a>3.1 - How the EcoLife Scam Works</b>
<p>There is a company called EcoLife, and the scam has no connection with the real company.</p>
<p>This scam is similar to the Swiss Invest scam above, and probably works in similar fashion. Naturally, it is difficult to know exactly what is planned, but we can be certain that someone else will benefit, and that we will end up with nothing more than an empty bank account and/or a prison sentence.</p>
<p>As for monster.com providing my e-mail address, this is pure fantasy. If monster.com has it, they obtained it illegally, since I have never given them my e-mail address, nor given anyone else permission to pass it on (to monster.com or anyone else).</p>

<hr><b><a id="s40"></a>4.0 - seek.com.au</b>

<p align="center"><img src="scamseek.gif" alt="Seek Scam" border="1"></p>

<p>Like the NAB scam (above), the displayed e-mail is a GIF file, and the underlying message is intended to confuse spam filters.  The message body is displayed below. Like the NAB scam, the message is meaningless drivel.

<p>This is probably one of the most pointless scams I've seen, but have no fear, the fraud artists have something up their collective sleeves.</p>

<hr><b><a id="s41"></a>4.1 - How the Seek Scam Works</b>
<p>I can only guess at what the plan is here. I think that the idea is to enable the criminals to post job ads that look legitimate, because they are listed on a well known employment site (<a href="http://seek.com.au" target="_blank">seek.com.au</a>). This is only a guess on my part, but seems the most likely purpose. It is also possible that they (the criminals) want to get access to company information, again, so they might be able to makes their fraud attempts appear legitimate to the average reader.</p>
<p>I have made a habit of accessing the sites that the criminals promote, and giving them all the details they want, but all are just made up on the fly. I deliberately choose login names that are highly unlikely to exist, and passwords that tell the criminals just what I think of them <img src="grin.gif">.</p>

<table width="80%" align="center"><tr><td>
Seek.com.au suggests the following ...<br>
Be wary of advertisers requesting the following information as part of the job application process:
<ul><li><small>An up front fee (e.g. for 'processing' your application)</small></li>
<li><small>Bank or credit card details</small></li>
<li><small>Drivers licence information</small></li>
<li><small>Tax File Number</small></li>
<li><small>Non work-related personal information, such as your appearance, marital status</small></li>
<li><small>SEEK username or password</small></li></ul>
Opportunities that seem to good to be true, usually are. Avoid employers who ask you to:
<ul><li><small>Forward, transfer, or 'wire' money to another person using a personal bank account</small></li>
<li><small>Transfer money and retain a portion for payment</small></li>
<li><small>Pay an up front fee for 'processing' your application or finding a placement</small></li>
<li><small>Start a job without an interview (either in person or by phone)</small></li></ul>
Also be wary of emails that seem to come from SEEK asking you to:
<ul><li><small>Verify your SEEK username or password</small></li>
<li><small>Urgently log into your SEEK account</small></li>
<li><small>Confirm bank or credit card details related to your SEEK account</small></li>
<li><small>Confirm the IP address from where you are accessing the SEEK site</small></li>
</ul></td></tr></table>

<p>This is all common sense, but can easily be forgotten if you are desperate. A sad state of affairs, but these are the people most commonly targeted by the scammers.</p>

<hr><b><a id="s50"></a>5.0 - WorldWideWeb Register</b>
<p>This is unbelievable, but even more concerning is that fact that there's so little info on the Net about the criminal activity carried on from Spain. A charming little bunch that call themselves GT@P - Guida Telefax Anuario Profesional, S.L. (B-60514635) send out an innocent looking document encouraging you to update your details. Quote ...</p>

<blockquote>With your cooperation, you are helping to keep the World Wide Web register up to date.</blockquote>

<p>A complete scan of the document is shown below (the added highlighting is mine). While it looks innocuous enough with a quick glance, you quickly discover the real agenda buried in the fine print.</p>

<center><img src="gt@p.gif" alt="GT@P Scam" border=1><br>
<small><b>GT@P Spanish WorldWideWeb Register Document</b></small></center>

<p>Note the highlighted sections, and particularly the "STAMP/LEGALLY BINDING SIGNATURE" panel. Normally, a signature on any document is automatically legally binding, so why did they make the point? That's simple ... because the document will be declared null and void by almost any court anywhere in the world, they have to try to convince the recipient that it really <i>is</i> binding. The German courts have already ruled that a company doing almost exactly the same thing in Germany should cease and desist, and change the deceptive wording - neither court order was obeyed.
<p>I'm almost tempted to sign and return the document, then refuse to pay - there is nothing they can actually do about it. Such a document is illegal in Australia, but perhaps the Spanish courts could try to take action from there ... not likely. No, I'm not signing it <img src="grin.gif" alt=":-)"></p>

<hr><b><a id="s51"></a>5.1 - How the WorldWideWeb Register Scam Works</b>
<p>This is simply a way to try to get the unsuspecting company or webmaster to commit to paying these scoundrels 877 Euros (AU$1500 close enough at the time of writing) for each of three editions of their CD (a total of AU$4500!), and for an advertisement on their (utterly useless) website.</p>
<p>The real scam is that the fees are buried in the fine print - most people will only read the first few lines of a paragraph. Since the first few lines just mention that ensuring your details are up-to-date and GT@P states that they are responsible for maintaining their database. They <i>imply</i> that they are responsible for a lot more - look at the title of their site. URLs are maintained by many registrars worldwide, and the ultimate responsibility falls to ICANN - Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. Some puissant scam company in Spain has nothing to do with the process - they simply want your money.
