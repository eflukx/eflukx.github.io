<hr><b>Introduction</b>
<p>The projects presented here are a mixture of basic and complex designs. Of these, most are originally designed by me, and have some unique quality which makes them worthy of publication, while others are simple extensions of basic theory. Not all have been built and verified, but with those that have not this is not an issue, since they cannot help but work. Of those which are not tested, they have all been simulated to verify that no stupid mistakes have been made, and will work on the first attempt ... if correctly built with the component values shown .</p>

<p>In general, these projects are not intended for the novice electronics hobbyist, since they all require some basic (or in some cases advanced) knowledge of electronic circuit construction, mounting power transistors, soldering techniques, mains wiring, etc. Make sure you read (and heed) all warnings and the <a href="disclaimer.htm">disclaimer</a> before starting construction. Some are very straightforward though, and are suitable for beginners - <i>provided</i> you already know basic theory, component types, and know how to solder properly.</p>

<small>Please note that each of the above links used to connect to a separate page, but now a single page with all project details is used. The original files remain because they have been indexed by search engines, but they will not be updated as of August 2012.</small>

<p>Each project description has one or more "flags", that indicate the status of the project itself.  Some are only available in the full list (in numerical order), while others are only shown in the category lists. The flags are as follows ...</p>
<table border="0">

<hr><a name="updates"></a><b>Updates</b>
<p>ESP reserves the right to change or update projects without notice, so it is important to be aware that a change may have been made.&nbsp; You should always watch for updates of previously published items.&nbsp; These are shown as a date beside the project (in the "Flags" column). Do not build any of the circuits presented here without checking for updates first.&nbsp; A "new" symbol indicates an update within the last two months or so (but this might vary). Special cases might be listed from time to time - these are likely to be important! Updates less than 3 months old will have the date in <b><font color="#ff0000">red</font></b>.</p>

<hr><a name="note"></a><b>Note Carefully</b>
<p>Please see the ESP <a href="disclaimer.htm">disclaimer</a> for important information</p>

<table border="1" width="100%" bgcolor="#ff0000">
<tbody><tr><td> 
<a name="warning"></a><center><font color="#ffffff"><b><u>WARNING</u></b></font></center><br>
<font color="#ffffff"><b><small>Mains wiring should be carried out by suitably qualified persons only. Under no circumstances should any reader construct any mains operated equipment unless <i>absolutely</i> sure of his/her abilities in this area. Death or serious injury (to the constructor or others) may be uncommon with home construction of mains powered projects, but the risk is ever-present. The author takes no responsibility for any injury or death resulting from, whether directly or indirectly, the reader's inability to appreciate the hazards of household mains voltages and the correct wiring practices for your country. Please read the <a href="disclaimer.htm">disclaimer</a> now if you have not done so already.</small></b></font></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>Although I am happy to provide assistance to prospective builders, I cannot (and will not) be drawn into prolonged e-mail exchanges if the project does not work as expected. I can say with complete confidence that all projects presented will work ... <i>if properly constructed according to the published design</i>. This is not to say that no help will be available - I will help where I can.</p>
<p>It is inevitable that in some cases (due to component tolerances, for example), a project may require a different value resistor, capacitor (or whatever) to correct for an unexpected variation. Since I cannot control or predict the quality of components sourced by readers, nor the standard of workmanship in assembly, it is not possible to allow for every contingency.</p>
<p>Please do not attempt the construction of any project which you do not fully understand, or if you do not feel completely confident that you can build the project without further assistance. Do not expect me to be able to diagnose an obscure fault remotely, and especially if the project has been modified in any way whatsoever.</p>
