<hr /><a id="s1"></a><b>1. - Introduction</b>
<p>In as far as it is possible, the articles presented on the ESP site are aimed at one thing - the truth. To be more exact, it is really my version of the truth, since truth is neither absolute nor tangible. There will be areas where it is later proven that I am (or was) wrong - I accept and welcome this.</p>

<p>At various times, I have been berated because I do not 'trust my ears', or that I have claimed that a product is fraudulent without having tested it at all. Guilty as charged - there are simply too many products that should be tested, and in a lot of cases the claims are so preposterous that testing is clearly unnecessary. While my ears remain a much used and relied upon test instrument, this is true only for my own tests - to be able to say anything with authority, I need hard evidence, not just add to the confusion by making unsubstantiated claims based on what I think I hear.</p>

<p>Ultimately, adopting the method used by the legal system that applies in many countries has a great deal of merit ... any claim (or counterclaim) should be based on its merits, and the result should be "<u>beyond reasonable doubt</u>". Mistakes will be (and have been) made, and new information is made available on a daily basis. What we need to ascertain is whether the claim(s) made seem likely or otherwise ... beyond reasonable doubt. Until such time as someone actually proves that their magic rock works - using proper scientific methods, documented and repeatable experiments and detailed measurement results, it is reasonable to doubt the claims. It is highly <i>unreasonable</i> to accept all such claims on face value.</p>

<p>There are many products that claim <i>massive</i> improvements over and above the standard offerings, without offering one single shred of evidence to show that the claim has any basis in reality. While it is apparently perfectly acceptable for the vendors of such products to make their claims unhindered, for some reason it is not alright for me to debunk these claims without having listened to the product myself (indeed, testing is often claimed <i>not</i> to be needed, or should be avoided!). In many cases, it really is not necessary to do so - the claims made have no relationship with reality, and wasting any time at all on such products is pointless.</p>

<p>Most commonly, magic component claims are riddled with pseudo-science, gobbledygook 'technical' specifications or references to proven characteristics of materials that, while passably interesting, have nothing to do with that material's performance in a piece of electronic equipment. This is a popular technique to convince the non-technical reader that there is real science involved, when in fact nothing could be further from the truth.</p>

<p>I cannot change the way that people think, and I have no desire to even attempt to do so - I present my material as is, and by virtue of the fact that I wrote most of the material, it comes with my own prejudices built in. To some readers, this is unacceptable (mainly because I don't agree with them), and is seen as a perfectly good reason to launch an attack ... most commonly in forum and bulletin board sites, and rarely by anyone who has ever bothered to send me an e-mail to discuss their point of view (or offer some real data to prove their point). There have been several cases over the years where I <i>have</i> been challenged, real data <i>has</i> been offered, and I have done further testing or investigation and made changes to the affected page(s) as a result.</p>

<p>There are great differences in the hearing ability of different people.  This changes from day to day, and is affected by mood, alcohol and other substances, minor illnesses and many other factors. That some people will hear things others cannot is a given, but no-one can hear sounds that are well below the general ambient noise floor, except under well controlled conditions and perhaps with specific sounds. A signal at 1dB SPL cannot be audible in the presence of another sound of similar frequency (range) at 110dB SPL, yet it is not uncommon to find claims that some individuals can hear sounds that would relate to -10dB SPL or less relative to the overall sound pressure. For example, if a 0dBV signal produces sound (via a power amplifier and loudspeaker) at 100dB SPL, then -100dBV is 0dB SPL - the threshold of hearing.  Anything below -100dBV will be inaudible in <i>absolute</i> terms, and completely inaudible relative to the overall SPL.</p>

<p><b><small>Please Note:  It is <u>very</u> important that one thing be made perfectly clear. No individual person or specific group of people is referenced herein by inference or deed, although it is possible that some readers may think that there is an oblique reference to them, their behaviour or their beliefs. This is not the case - this article refers only to generalised examples of particular behaviour, and no specific or individual person or group is stated or implied. There is one exception, which follows</small> ...</b></p>
<p>Furthermore, this is not intended to be a thesis on philosophy, and it is inevitable that you will find inconsistencies, contradictions and more. In fact, such is life. Just as audio is built from compromises, so life itself is filled with inconsistencies and contradictions.</p>

<hr /><b><a id="s2"></a>2. - What is Truth?</b>
<p>Krishnamurti said in 1929 (in a speech where he disbanded the Order of the Star - of which he was the head) ...</p>

<center><table width="85%" border=0><tr><td><small><b>I maintain that Truth is a pathless land, and you cannot approach it by any path whatsoever, by any religion, by any sect. That is my point of view, and I adhere to that absolutely and unconditionally. Truth, being limitless, unconditioned, unapproachable by any path whatsoever, cannot be organised; nor should any organisation be formed to lead or to coerce people along any particular path. If you first understand that, then you will see how impossible it is to organise a belief. A belief is purely an individual matter, and you cannot and must not organise it. If you do, it becomes dead, crystallised; it becomes a creed, a sect, a religion, to be imposed on others. This is what everyone throughout the world is attempting to do. Truth is narrowed down and made a plaything for those who are weak, for those who are only momentarily discontented. Truth cannot be brought down, rather the individual must make the effort to ascend to it. You cannot bring the mountain-top to the valley. If you would attain to the mountain-top you must pass through the valley, climb the steeps, unafraid of the dangerous precipices.</b>

<br /><br />Reproduced with the kind permission of the Krishnamurti Foundation of America <a href="#ref">[1]</a></small></td></tr></table></center>

<p>This is such an eloquent description of truth that it almost certainly cannot be bettered. It is just as relevant to the pursuit of excellence in audio as anything else, although I'm sure Krishnamurti would have considered this to be rather trivial compared to the spiritual context he referred to. Trivial or not, the fact remains that the essential principles of which he spoke are just as valid in the field of audio as spirituality, and indeed anywhere that several competing versions of 'truth' exist side by side. This is rarely a peaceful coexistence - examples abound in the world around us, and we have seen the terrible destruction of life (and property) in the name of one truth or another.</p>

<p>We have also seen the almost religious fervour with which some people will defend their point of view or favourite piece of sound equipment. Likewise, we see attacks (sometimes very vicious) on those who do <i>not</i> believe in pseudo-science, magic components or rocks (special or otherwise).  To criticise is seen as heresy by some, and pity he who has the gall and audacity to openly state that $10,000 speaker cables (for example) are not the path to Nirvana.</p>

<p>Such extravagances may make their owners think their system is something Heaven-sent, however it is completely unreasonable and unacceptable that they will attack someone else who claims that the cable had nothing to do with the sound, or for another to claim that such sound is impossible to achieve <i>without</i> the 'special' (or magic) cables/ components used. It is simply impossible for either party to win such an argument, and it is best for all if they could agree to disagree and leave it at that.</p>

<p>Much of what is at issue is based on the oft-repeated claim that there are many things that simply cannot be measured, and only our ears will be able to pick the subtle improvements offered by the product. There is no point asking anyone making that claim to prove it, nor is there any point trying to convince the person otherwise. It is their belief, and to them it is true.</p>

<p><i>However</i> ... How much of their belief has come from elsewhere? To what extent is the belief something that has been formed after years of listening to music on different systems and taking detailed measurements, versus listening to the proclamations of the <a href="#bk">Black Knight</a> 'gurus' whose belief system was built on an unknown premise? Does the cable vendor (for example) <u>genuinely</u> believe that his product is as good as he claims, or it the whole exercise a cynical ploy to separate the buyer from his hard earned cash? We simply do not know the answers to these questions, and further probing for the answer will only infuriate the persons involved. The net gain is zero - to all parties.</p>

<hr /><b><a id="s3"></a>3. - Truth Versus Belief</b>
<p>The problem is that each of us has our own truth, and this is arrived at by many and various means. In some cases it is nothing more than a belief, and it must be accepted by others that this is valid for the person who believes. Although we may challenge the belief, it is rare (to the point of being virtually unheard of) for people to simply drop one belief system for another.</p>

<p>In other cases, our truth is the result of research, testing and measuring. Should we find no evidence that a particular type of cable or component makes an audible difference, then that becomes our truth. This must also include pure analysis, without measurement or listening test. For example, if it is suggested that demagnetising plastic materials makes a difference to the sound of an audio system, there is little point in anyone with an analytical mind testing this. Since it is well known that no commonly used plastic can be magnetised, there is no point 'demagnetising' it. Simple analysis indicates that demagnetisation and a resultant improvement in sound quality are impossible, when the base material <i>cannot</i> be magnetised in the first place. Perhaps there is some other mechanism at work, but it is certainly <u>not</u> magnetism.</p>

<p>But, what of the beliefs of those who have demagnetised non-magnetic materials, and say that the difference is astonishing? Are they demented, or have they succumbed to the placebo effect? Could they be right? I can't answer this, and nor can anyone else. To me, they are the unknowing victims of a fraud, and have chosen to believe that their hard earned money was indeed well spent, and not wasted making the fraudster rich. It is important to understand that despite this, <i>their experience is real to them!</i></p>

<p>Neither you nor I can convince them that they are wrong, any more than they will be able to convince me that the effects are real. If it cannot be measured (bearing in mind that the digital signal can be analysed byte-by-byte) then I shall remain unconvinced, since there is zero proof to support the contention. Billions of characters of electronic and conventional (paper) storage are devoted to arguments between the different 'camps', be it religion, politics, audio, cars, 'free' energy, conspiracy theorists etc., etc.</p>

<p><i>No-one wins these arguments - <b>ever</b></i>. They are un-winnable in any forum, since no-one can convince anyone against their will. All that anyone can do is to explain in a reasoned and (hopefully) rational manner that <i>they</i> believe that the claims are false, giving sound reasoning and clear details of the facts as they are understood. In any case, the 'true believer' will not be swayed by any argument, however rational or well reasoned - and lest you may think that I am approaching this from my own perspective, this applies both ways.</p>

<p>A cable believer will be just as incapable of persuading me to change my mind as I will be incapable of changing his - we each have our own truth, and it is completely true - but only to the one person. I base my beliefs on what I can measure, since I believe that measuring equipment can resolve details that cannot be heard under any conditions. For example,  although I know that I can measure the microphony of a cable (i.e. its ability to act as a microphone when vibrated), I also know that the signal level is infinitesimally small when the same cable is loaded with the typical impedances of the source and load. Some claim that this is in fact audible, and to them, this may be true. It may also be true that they <i>think</i> they can hear it, and a double blind test (DBT) would show that they can't. We cannot force anyone to perform a DBT, exacting measurements, or  anything else against their will.</p>

<p>There is no answer - people will continue to believe what they want to believe, and all anyone can do is to present the facts as they know (or believe) them to be. One can do no more.</p>

<hr /><b><a id="s4"></a>4. - What is Science and Belief?</b>
<p>Two excellent articles that explain the concepts of beliefs are "What is Science, anyway?" [<a href="#ref">2</a>] and The Belief Engine [<a href="#ref">3</a>]. These two articles are recommended reading, but there is a great deal of other information available from any search engine.</p>

<p><b>What is Science?</b><br />
"Science is the systematic enterprise of gathering knowledge about the world, and organising and condensing that knowledge into testable laws and principles." This rather elegant description is from biologist E.O. Wilson's book "Consilience" [<a href="#ref">4</a>]. That laws and principles will change over time is a given, since we are always learning. Very little science (none that I can think of) has grown from pure belief - the gathering of evidence is hard work.</p> 

<p>In short, science is knowledge based - all scientific principles are based on what we <i>know</i> rather than what we may believe. Science is a process of assembling knowledge, correlating that with other knowledge, and testing the outcomes to determine a set of rules (or 'laws') that govern the interactions between materials and/or energy.  Without the testing and verification, there is no science.  If the tests are not repeatable by others, there is no science. Anything that cannot be verified or measured, relies on opinion or subjective reports (hearsay) falls into the following category ...</p>

<p><b>What is Belief?</b><br />
Simply stated, a belief is based on something that we cannot prove, and requires <i>faith</i>. We do not 'believe' in the existence of air or water, for example, since we <i>know</i> that they exist. Some may <i>believe</i> that they can live on air or water with no other sustenance, and this belief will stay with them until they either die of malnutrition or come to their senses. Thus, it may be demonstrated that faith is not enough, and that we cannot live on air or water alone - such beliefs are not real to the majority of people. Other beliefs that are not so easily disproved are much harder to deal with. The longer a belief has been held, the harder it will be to convince the believer that s/he is mistaken.</p>

<p>What of God or magic components? These are beliefs - neither can be proven to the satisfaction of any observer, so there will be those who believe in God and those who do not. Some will believe that God is different from the (false) God of other believers, that S/He has different rules, is benevolent, fearsome, omnipotent, or just 'there'. Others (agnostics) may take the wait and see approach, which according to some believers guarantees the agnostics will suffer eternal damnation. There are no facts either way, so no-one can actually be right <i>or</i> wrong - they simply have different beliefs, and will not change readily.</p>

<p>Likewise in audio (and indeed many other pursuits) - some believe in magic components, others do not. The non-believers may be agnostic or full-bodied non-believers, but the end result is much the same. Although it is possible to prove that a great many of the magic component claims are false, this proof will only affect those who are already non-believers or agnostics. The believers will claim that the proof is bogus, just as the non-believers will claim that the reasons given that the magic <i>works</i> is bogus.</p>

<p>I like to think of the believers in magic components as 'naysayers', since (to me) they refuse to see reality. To them, I am the naysayer, since I refuse to believe that there is any magic in components, and I believe that all audible effects can be measured.</p>

<p><a id="bk"></a>There are some that fall into a special category I call the 'Black Knights' - as in the Black Knight of Monty Python fame, who refuses to accept that he can no longer fight, even after he has lost both arms and legs. Some of the Black Knights of the audio world have been brutalised and scorned by many, and some observers might say with considerable justification. Their beliefs are so strongly held that no argument, no rational discussion of the facts, no possible reason, will sway them from their often ludicrous postulations. Rarely (if ever) does the Black Knight have a website with detailed diagrams, test results and measurements.  Often (if they <i>do</i> exist), the data will be lacking certain critical information, without which it is essentially meaningless. There will nearly always be other people who agree with the Black Knights for reasons of their own, and who believe that the claims are reasonable and rational. They will leap to the defence of a downed Knight regardless of the rationality of the detractor's claims, and most often also without a shred of hard evidence to back up their position.</p>

<p>To me, this behaviour is denial - they deny that there is anything wrong with their claims, they deny that any proof to the contrary is valid, (regardless of the qualifications or reputation of the person providing the proof), and they will deny that there is anything to deny. The arguments used are usually ad-hoc, often (ever so slightly) off-topic, and almost always emotional rather than rational. In exactly the same way, a creationist will deny that the proof of evolution is valid, or a conspiracy theorist will deny that any proof of man's moon-walk is valid.</p>

<p>To take it to an extreme, the Flat-Earth Society (and yes, it does exist) refuses to believe or accept that the photos taken from space prove anything (they will typically claim they are all faked), and despite the fact that not one of them has ever fallen off the edge of the world, it is still flat - regardless of the awful paradox that creates with air travel, the existence of the horizon, etc. These are the ultimate Black Knights - are they completely mad? I don't know, and I don't much care either, the truth be known.</p>

<p>Naturally, some of the claims made by (some of) the Black Knights will be valid and may be proved easily, and this makes it much harder for the layman to separate fact from fiction. Only by experimentation and education will people be able to see what is (or is likely to be) true, and what is based on faith or is complete fabrication. In some cases, a claim can easily appear to be completely rational and have scientific validity, but without evidence and repeatable test results it should be treated with suspicion.</p>

<hr /><b><a id="s5"></a>5. - Perpetual Motion in a Different Form?</b>
<p>The proponents of 'overunity' or Perpetual Motion Machines (PMMs) have a similar philosophy of life to that of the magic component proponents and/ or vendors. Essentially, they feel that their discoveries are so important that <i>no-one</i> should overlook them, yet both groups will reveal nothing tangible about how their creations actually do what is claimed.</p>

<p>Any information that is provided requires that you must take it at face value, and only after a purchase will you discover the truth - namely that it does not work, or at least, does not work as claimed. These people seem to have a disconnect with reality, and believe that established science fails to see the importance of their work, is blind to the benefits, or even deliberately withholding the truth.</p>

<p>Having purchased the magic component or plans for the PMM, in many cases the buyer may convince himself that it works, for to do otherwise is to admit to having been duped.</p>

<p>The claims in both cases are very similar - you will get benefits that are way beyond what simple physics would indicate, and these people will protest that established science simply does not understand the principles involved. No amount of mathematical or measured performance proof will ever make a difference to their beliefs, and will be simply deemed wrong, inappropriate or misguided. They will vehemently deny that their own claims are wrong, inappropriate or misguided, and will reject any proffered proof out of hand.</p>

<p>In many cases, the PMM brigade will defend their position with words alone, and would rather continue with endless debate than spend some time in the lab or workshop fabricating their invention (and thus proving the claims), and rendering all further words superfluous.</p>

<p>The magic component believers will do exactly the same thing, but with a twist. They do build equipment and test their inventions, but refuse to perform meaningful measurements, double-blind tests or anything else that would prove or disprove the claimed benefits once and for all.</p>

<p>Both groups are rather like the alchemists of old, and think that all they need is sufficient faith and purity of thought to achieve things that are in fact virtually impossible. The scientific approach is considered 'defective', because it does not embrace their beliefs.</p>

<p>There are many examples that will be brought up where science has been proven wrong in the past. Splitting the atom or exceeding the speed of sound are two classic examples, since everyone used to consider both to be impossible. Now that they have been shown to be perfectly possible, the same logic is applied to their own creations ... "<i>Since the scientists were proven wrong then, so shall they be in the future when my claims are examined properly.</i>"  The flaw (from their perspective) is in current thinking, which disallows the proof that their PMM, cable or 'universal distortion and noise canceller' (etcetera) will actually do what they think it does.</p>

<p>Then there is the 'undiscovered law of physics' that can be brought to bear if a detractor is particularly persistent. While it is quite possible that there really is an undiscovered law, it will not negate the current and well proven concepts of conservation of energy, thermodynamics, or any other basic principles. Any such new law (should it exist in the future) will add greater understanding of existing principles rather than make the currently used physical laws obsolete.</p>

<p>To these people, Einstein's special law of relativity should read ...</p>

<blockquote>E = mc&sup2; &nbsp; &plusmn;3dB</blockquote>

<p>... and the uncertainly factor allows them the latitude needed to enable their process to function as claimed. Sadly for them, this is not the case.</p>

<p>In a similar vein, there are many who believe that everything is black or white, true or false. There is no grey (which translates to uncertainty). In fact, the grey area is usually where the real truth is to be found, this is the area that should be examined most closely, for in doing so one will learn a great deal about himself, and potentially a great deal about the way the world works.</p>

<p>In this context, there used to be a claim that "you can't have trees and grass too" - this was the common cry of early sheep farmers in Australia. This belief resulted in the wholesale removal of trees, and the result is now decimation of the land - massive soil erosion, rising salt tables that threaten (or make useless) more and more land each year. The claim in itself is true, but without examining the grey area, the actual <i>reasons</i> were not seen, and trees were simply cut down.</p>

<p>So, what are the reasons? I present one possible reason that is potentially quite simple, although I <i>do not</i> claim this to be the final answer - just one of many possibilities that will only be seen when the grey area is explored ...

<ul>
	<li>Sheep are cold climate animals.</li>
	<li>Australia (especially inland) gets very hot.</li>
	<li>The sheep will head for the coolest areas they can find. Under ... trees.</li>
	<li>While there, in the relative cool, they will eat!</li>
	<li>Before long, there will be no grass under the trees.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, it is not <i>because</i> of the trees there is no grass underneath, but because the sheep have eaten it all while trying to keep cool. In addition, sheep are hard hoofed animals, and Australian native grasses evolved with only the native mammals - none of which is hoofed!</p>

<p>Removing the trees was obviously a <u>big</u> mistake, and the real reason for no grass beneath the trees was neglected in the rush to 'solve' the 'problem'. In fact, trees may allow grass to grow better, especially in the areas shaded from the morning sun - I can see this in my own backyard! I can likewise lament this when I have to mow the very thick grass thus shaded, which grows like crazy during summer. In the areas that get full morning sun, the grass growth is much more subdued.</p>

<p>Ok, but what on earth does this have to do with electronics, audio, PMMs or anything else?</p>

<p>Good question, simple answer, but with complex understanding. The grey area of all things is that which is unknown. There is no immediate right or wrong, true or false, real or unreal. To get to the answers is difficult, time consuming, and in some cases expensive. It requires one to think, long and hard, to discuss and to examine and reject theories. It is not the easy path.</p>

<p>On the other hand, to accept someone else's theory (e.g. "Oh, don't even <i>try</i> to understand it - it's magic!") is easy, but you then fall into the very trap that Krishnamurti warned against. 'Truth' is packaged, sanitised and instutionalised, you are warned that you must never question that which is 'written in stone'. This applies to politics, religion, finance, hi-fi and almost anything else you can think of. To accept the 'word' is the easy way - you no longer <i>need</i> to question, examine or experiment, or to search further for enlightenment. You have been told - it must be true because so many others also believe, and anyone who questions this truth is an heretic.</p>

<p>This principle was used to great effect by the Spanish Inquisition, and is used today to push the current fiscal policy, someone's belief in 'world order', and at the trivial end of the scale, to attempt to silence those who criticise the high end cable vendors.</p>

<p>A new belief can come about so easily that it is scary ...

<blockquote>
Someone thinks they hear a difference between two components. At first, they may be unsure, so will ask someone else. The second listener may say "I do believe you're right - I'm <i>sure</i> I hear a difference too." At this stage, they may (or may not) actually hear a difference, and it is more likely that they have fallen victim to the 'experimenter expectancy' effect.<br /><br />
Along comes another - he may be unsure, but it's two against one now, so he may well bow to the pressure and <i>think</i> that he too hears a difference (this is called self-delusion, and is far more common that most people realise). Anyone who comes along after that either goes with the flow, or admits he has 'tin ears' and is ostracised from the new clique.<br /><br />
Advance a few years, and this vague belief has become the truth!
</blockquote>

<p>Those who refuse to believe this (new) truth are naysayers, have tin ears and are deluded! <b>Of course</b> they are! The truth has been laid before them, and they refuse to see it. They are blind to the truth, and insist on trying to explain away the magic with mere science! By now, the clique has grown to cult status, it brandishes its truth as fact, and the heretics who refuse to believe are ostracised, categorised, criticised, and put aside - until they come to their senses. This is identical to the old tale of "The Emperor's New Clothes" [<a href="#ref">5</a>], where everyone claimed to behold fine garments that never existed.</p>

<p>Does any of this sound familiar?</p>

<hr /><b><a id="s6"></a>6. - Definition of Proof</b>
<p>Despite the reservations some may have, proof is not difficult to explain.  Simply stated ...</p>

<blockquote>Proof may be defined as an experiment or test result whose outcome is demonstrably different from that predicted by random variations as may be found in similar devices or processes (i.e. the results must be statistically significant).  To be valid, the experiment or test procedure <u>must</u> be repeatable, using equipment that need not be identical but has similar specifications, is not modified in any way that will produce the outcome independently of the characteristics of the device under test, and does not rely on guesswork in any form.

<p>In other words, if anyone takes a measurement that shows a particular behaviour (positive or negative) with a particular component, then anyone else with similar equipment should be able to duplicate the results. Proof of any behavioural characteristic does <u>not</u> imply anything else.  For example, if I were to prove that certain component leads were magnetic, then that (and <i>only</i> that) is relevant.  If I then postulate that this degrades the sound quality, there is no proof of this, merely speculation or guesswork based on the original finding. It is necessary to then <i>prove</i> that there is a degradation, and if I cannot (or will not) do so then my postulation remains <u>an opinion</u> only - it is not a fact, it has not been proven, and may or may not be true.</p>

<p>Most people who attempt any form of proof will make mistakes. They may overlook something, or be unaware of a characteristic of one or more of the components. Their proof will be flawed, and will almost certainly be challenged.</p>

<p>Those who take a scientific approach will (usually) re-examine the new data, and may decide that it is irrelevant or important.  If the latter, they will usually look more closely at the claim and their proof, and often find that they were indeed wrong. They may well be miffed (I have been on several occasions <img src="grin.gif">), but will generally publish a correction once the new data is correlated and the experimental processes are repeatable.</p>

<p>By contrast, there are those who rely on postulation (or proclamation) alone, and do not even attempt to prove their claims. Given the lack of evidence the claims must therefore be viewed with suspicion, since without any offered proof, there are no facts to work with. Emotive comments, unsubstantiated 'evidence', and hearsay don't amount to a hill of beans in the real world, and any complaint that modern equipment is not sensitive enough to measure the difference is simply bollocks.</p>

<p>"I heard a difference" is <u>not</u> evidence, merely a claim or hearsay, unless the test was performed using a properly conducted Double-Blind Test methodology, with a statistically significant outcome. The majority of magic component vendors and proponents eschew the DBT, and will use all manner of (usually ridiculous) arguments to support their position, such as "the DBT equipment degrades the sound so much that the test is meaningless" or "DB Testing is too stressful, so you never get the correct result".  This is simply rubbish, and should be seen in every case as a&nbsp;priori evidence that the claims made are grossly exaggerated or simply balderdash.</p>

<blockquote>
	<small><i>A proposition is knowable 'a priori' if it is knowable independently of experience</i> [<a href="#ref">7</a>]</small>
</blockquote>

<p>In some cases, it is entirely possible that a test methodology really does not exist to prove or disprove the claim, but the proponents of magic components will never, <i>ever</i> attempt to devise a method to prove that what they say is true, for to do so would almost certainly amount to shooting themselves in the foot. They know that they are talking through their hats much of the time, but they certainly don't want <u>you</u> to know that - especially if they want you to buy their product.</p>

<p>In some cases, the vendor may genuinely believe that his magic component works. He may be passionate about it to the point of being fanatical, and have such faith in the benefits that he is blind to all reason. He <i>cannot</i> accept any proof that the device simply doesn't work.  The only 'proof' needed is letters of commendation (no, not condemnation) from users or reviewers, but there will be no technical information, no graphs or charts showing the before and after effects.  No test equipment will ever be brought to bear, for this may shake the faith when it is demonstrated that no change can be found.  It is important to understand that this is still technically fraud, regardless of the beliefs of the vendor. A device must actually perform the described functions, and this should be based on evidence, not hearsay.</p>

<hr /><b><a id="s7"></a>7. - Conclusion</b>
<p>So, to summarise the general philosophy of The Audio Pages and myself, I can safely state that ...</p>

<ul>
  <li>I do <i>not</i> believe in magic components, fantastic 'capabilities' of certain interconnects, speaker or mains cables, magic lacquers, overunity or perpetual motion machines, or other amazing claims that are made regularly on the Web.<br /><br /></li>

  <li>If a component makes an audible difference, then I believe that it will be possible to measure the difference between the standard and improved component. It is unlikely (IMO) that any non-measurable differences are audible, but it is possible that a measurement technique may not have been thought of to quantify some subjective differences. This is an area that I am looking at closely in a number of areas (mainly loudspeakers).<br /><br /></li>

<li>There is considerable evidence that a great many measurable differences in components exist that are not audible, but virtually nothing to support the opposing viewpoint.<br /><br /></li>

<li>It is highly unlikely that there is a flaw in current science or thinking that prevents PMMs or 'magic components' from working. Note that it is the flaw in <i>thinking</i> that causes the problem - not the 'undiscovered mechanism', which is presumably somehow obscured by current thinking, thus preventing its discovery by the many followers of such theories. <small>Hmmm.  I'm not sure that <b>I</b> even follow that one &nbsp;</small> <img src="grin.gif"><br /><br /></li>

  <li>The opinions expressed on these pages are primarily my own, and although some articles have been contributed, the content is substantially in agreement with my own ideas and beliefs.<br /><br /></li>

  <li>Contrary to what some people may claim, I do not automatically denounce the theories of others when they do not agree with my own. Indeed, there have been cases where I set out to prove that something made no difference, only to find that it is important, and does have audible consequences (time alignment, for example).<br /><br /></li>

  <li>As a matter of course, I keep an open mind on a great deal of material, and just because I cannot disprove it does not make it 'wrong'. There are, however, some claims that are just too outrageous or stupid to even consider, and it is no more being 'closed minded' to scoff at such claims than it is to scoff at the Flat-Earth Society's beliefs.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a great many things that I don't know, and as I grow older and (hopefully) wiser, I realise that the more I know, the more there remains to know - this will no doubt continue until the day I die. The primary aim of the ESP site is to educate and enlighten - and I have had so many e-mails of thanks that I can only conclude that a lot of people have found benefit and knowledge from the articles and projects.</p>

<p>This was always my aim, and it is hoped that the majority of readers will appreciate and welcome the information presented. For those who think that the site is biased and does not fit with their beliefs, then I can only suggest that you go elsewhere - I will no more change my beliefs than you will yours. Argument is futile, wastes a great deal of time, and rarely if ever achieves anything worthwhile.</p>

<p>Just because you disagree with one or more of the things said on the site does not mean that nothing is valid. All are welcome to browse, and to join and participate in the ESP Forum (whilst abiding by the rules). The greater the participation, the greater benefit to all who visit - this is not a place for 'I win, you lose' arguments - it is intended to be a place where everyone can win.</p>

<p>It must be remembered at all times that <i>any claim that seems too good to be true, almost certainly is!</i> There is no appeal against the laws of physics, and any claim to the contrary is false, and should be an instant warning that something is seriously wrong. While it is more than possible that there are still things that have not been discovered, they are unlikely to be of such massive importance that our listening habits will be forever changed - i.e. they will be evolutionary rather than revolutionary. Any such discoveries are far more likely to be made by well equipped laboratories than backyard tinkerers or 'magic component' suppliers.</p>
